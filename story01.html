Prehistory and Ancient Egypt<br><br>

There is evidence of rock carvings along the Nile terraces and in desert oases. In the 10th millennium BC, a culture of hunter-gatherers and fishers was replaced by a grain-grinding culture. Climate changes and/or overgrazing around 8000 BC began to desiccate the pastoral lands of Egypt, forming the Sahara. Early tribal peoples migrated to the Nile River where they developed a settled agricultural economy and more centralized society.<br><br>

By about 6000 BC, a Neolithic culture rooted in the Nile Valley.[19] During the Neolithic era, several predynastic cultures developed independently in Upper and Lower Egypt. The Badarian culture and the successor Naqada series are generally regarded as precursors to dynastic Egypt. The earliest known Lower Egyptian site, Merimda, predates the Badarian by about seven hundred years. Contemporaneous Lower Egyptian communities coexisted with their southern counterparts for more than two thousand years, remaining culturally distinct, but maintaining frequent contact through trade. The earliest known evidence of Egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions appeared during the predynastic period on Naqada III pottery vessels, dated to about 3200 BC.<br><br>
A unified kingdom was founded c. 3150 BC by King Menes, leading to a series of dynasties that ruled Egypt for the next three millennia. Egyptian culture flourished during this long period and remained distinctively Egyptian in its religion, arts, language and customs. The first two ruling dynasties of a unified Egypt set the stage for the Old Kingdom period, c. 2700C2200 BC., which constructed many pyramids, most notably the Third Dynasty pyramid of Djoser and the Fourth Dynasty Giza Pyramids.<br><br>

The First Intermediate Period ushered in a time of political upheaval for about 150 years.[21] Stronger Nile floods and stabilization of government, however, brought back renewed prosperity for the country in the Middle Kingdom c. 2040 BC, reaching a peak during the reign of Pharaoh Amenemhat III. A second period of disunity heralded the arrival of the first foreign ruling dynasty in Egypt, that of the Semitic Hyksos. The Hyksos invaders took over much of Lower Egypt around 1650 BC and founded a new capital at Avaris. They were driven out by an Upper Egyptian force led by Ahmose I, who founded the Eighteenth Dynasty and relocated the capital from Memphis to Thebes.<br><br>

The New Kingdom c. 1550C1070 BC began with the Eighteenth Dynasty, marking the rise of Egypt as an international power that expanded during its greatest extension to an empire as far south as Tombos in Nubia, and included parts of the Levant in the east. This period is noted for some of the most well known Pharaohs, including Hatshepsut, Thutmose III, Akhenaten and his wife Nefertiti, Tutankhamun and Ramesses II. The first historically attested expression of monotheism came during this period as Atenism. Frequent contacts with other nations brought new ideas to the New Kingdom. The country was later invaded and conquered by Libyans, Nubians and Assyrians, but native Egyptians eventually drove them out and regained control of their country.[22]<br><br>

The Thirtieth Dynasty was the last native ruling dynasty during the Pharaonic epoch. It fell to the Persians in 343 BC after the last native Pharaoh, King Nectanebo II, was defeated in battle.<br><br>


Ptolemaic and Roman Egypt
<br><br>
The Ptolemaic Kingdom was a powerful Hellenistic state, extending from southern Syria in the east, to Cyrene to the west, and south to the frontier with Nubia. Alexandria became the capital city and a center of Greek culture and trade. To gain recognition by the native Egyptian populace, they named themselves as the successors to the Pharaohs. The later Ptolemies took on Egyptian traditions, had themselves portrayed on public monuments in Egyptian style and dress, and participated in Egyptian religious life.<br><br>

The last ruler from the Ptolemaic line was Cleopatra VII, who committed suicide following the burial of her lover Mark Antony who had died in her arms (from a self-inflicted stab wound), after Octavian had captured Alexandria and her mercenary forces had fled. The Ptolemies faced rebellions of native Egyptians often caused by an unwanted regime and were involved in foreign and civil wars that led to the decline of the kingdom and its annexation by Rome. Nevertheless Hellenistic culture continued to thrive in Egypt well after the Muslim conquest.<br><br>

Christianity was brought to Egypt by Saint Mark the Evangelist in the 1st century.[25] Diocletian's reign marked the transition from the Roman to the Byzantine era in Egypt, when a great number of Egyptian Christians were persecuted. The New Testament had by then been translated into Egyptian. After the Council of Chalcedon in AD 451, a distinct Egyptian Coptic Church was firmly established.<br><br>


Middle Ages<br><br>

The Byzantines were able to regain control of the country after a brief Persian invasion early in the 7th century, until 639C42, when Egypt was invaded and conquered by the Islamic Empire by the Muslim Arabs. When they defeated the Byzantine Armies in Egypt, the Arabs brought Sunni Islam to the country. Early in this period, Egyptians began to blend their new faith with indigenous beliefs and practices, leading to various Sufi orders that have flourished to this day.[25] These earlier rites had survived the period of Coptic Christianity.<br><br>

Muslim rulers nominated by the Islamic Caliphate remained in control of Egypt for the next six centuries, with Cairo as the seat of the Caliphate under the Fatimids. With the end of the Kurdish Ayyubid dynasty, the Mamluks, a Turco-Circassian military caste, took control about AD 1250. By the late 13th century, Egypt linked the Red Sea, India, Malaya, and East Indies.[28] The mid-14th-century Black Death killed about 40% of the country's population.<br><br>


History of Ottoman Egypt<br><br>

The brief French invasion of Egypt led by Napoleon Bonaparte began in 1798. After the French were defeated by the British, a power vacuum was created in Egypt, and a three-way power struggle ensued between the Ottoman Turks, Egyptian Mamluks who had ruled Egypt for centuries, and Albanian mercenaries in the service of the Ottomans. It ended in victory for the Albanians led by Muhammad Ali.<br><br>

While he carried the title of viceroy of Egypt, his subordination to the Ottoman porte was merely nominal. Muhammad Ali established a dynasty that was to rule Egypt until the revolution of 1952. In later years, the dynasty became a British puppet.<br><br>

The introduction in 1820 of long-staple cotton transformed its agriculture into a cash-crop monoculture before the end of the century, concentrating land ownership and shifting production towards international markets.<br><br>

Muhammad Ali annexed Northern Sudan (1820C1824), Syria (1833), and parts of Arabia and Anatolia; but in 1841 the European powers, fearful lest he topple the Ottoman Empire itself, forced him to return most of his conquests to the Ottomans. His military ambition required him to modernize the country: he built industries, a system of canals for irrigation and transport, and reformed the civil service.<br><br>

Muhammad Ali was succeeded briefly by his son Ibrahim (in September 1848), then by a grandson Abbas I (in November 1848), then by Said (in 1854), and Isma'il (in 1863).<br><br>

The Suez Canal, built in partnership with the French, was completed in 1869. Its construction led to enormous debt to European banks, and caused popular discontent because of the onerous taxation it required. In 1875 Ismail was forced to sell Egypt's share in the canal to the British Government. Within three years this led to the imposition of British and French controllers who sat in the Egyptian cabinet, and, "with the financial power of the bondholders behind them, were the real power in the Government."<br><br>

Local dissatisfaction with Ismail and with European intrusion led to the formation of the first nationalist groupings in 1879, with Ahmad Urabi a prominent figure. Fearing a reduction of their control, the UK and France intervened militarily, bombarding Alexandria and crushing the Egyptian army at the battle of Tel el-Kebir.[34] They reinstalled Ismail's son Tewfik as figurehead of a de facto British protectorate.[35] In 1906, the Dinshaway Incident prompted many neutral Egyptians to join the nationalist movement.<br><br>

In 1914, the Protectorate was made official, and the title of the head of state was changed to sultan, to repudiate the vestigial suzerainty of the Ottoman sultan, who was backing the Central powers in World War I. Abbas II was deposed as khedive and replaced by his uncle, Hussein Kamel, as sultan.[36]<br><br>

After the First World War, Saad Zaghlul and the Wafd Party led the Egyptian nationalist movement to a majority at the local Legislative Assembly. When the British exiled Zaghlul and his associates to Malta on 8 March 1919, the country arose in its first modern revolution. The revolt led the UK government to issue a unilateral declaration of Egypt's independence on 22 February 1922.[37]<br><br>

The new government drafted and implemented a constitution in 1923 based on a parliamentary system. Saad Zaghlul was popularly elected as Prime Minister of Egypt in 1924. In 1936, the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty was concluded. Continued instability due to remaining British influence and increasing political involvement by the king led to the dissolution of the parliament in a military coup d'état known as the 1952 Revolution. The Free Officers Movement forced King Farouk to abdicate in support of his son Fuad. British military presence in Egypt lasted until 1954.<br><br>

Republic<br><br>

Free Officers rule<br><br>

Following the 1952 Revolution by the Free Officers Movement, the rule of Egypt passed to military hands. On 18 June 1953, the Egyptian Republic was declared, with General Muhammad Naguib as the first President of the Republic. Naguib was forced to resign in 1954 by Gamal Abdel Nasser C the real architect of the 1952 movement C and was later put under house arrest. Nasser assumed power as President in June 1956. British forces completed their withdrawal from the occupied Suez Canal Zone on 13 June 1956. He nationalized the Suez Canal on 26 July 1956, prompting the 1956 Suez Crisis.<br><br>

In 1958, Egypt and Syria formed a sovereign union known as the United Arab Republic. The union was short-lived, ending in 1961 when Syria seceded, thus ending the union. During most of its existence, the United Arab Republic was also in a loose confederation with North Yemen (formerly the Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen), known as the United Arab States. In 1959, the All-Palestine Government of the Gaza Strip, an Egyptian client state, was absorbed into United Arab Republic under the pretext of Arab union, and was never restored.<br><br>

In early 1960s, Egypt became fully involved in the North Yemen Civil War. The Egyptian President, Gamal Abdel Nasser, supported the Yemeni republicans with as many as 70,000 Egyptian troops and chemical weapons. Despite several military moves and peace conferences, the war sank into a stalemate. Egyptian commitment in Yemen was greatly undermined, when in the 1967 Six Day War, Israel invaded and occupied Egypt's Sinai Peninsula and the Gaza Strip, which Egypt had occupied since the 1948 ArabCIsraeli War. During the 1967 war, an Emergency Law was enacted, and remained in effect until 2012, with the exception of an 18-month break in 1980/81.[39]<br><br>

In 1970, President Nasser died and was succeeded by Anwar Sadat. Sadat switched Egypt's Cold War allegiance from the Soviet Union to the United States, expelling Soviet advisors in 1972. He launched the Infitah economic reform policy, while clamping down on religious and secular opposition. In 1973, Egypt, along with Syria, launched the October War, a surprise attack to regain part of the Sinai territory Israel had captured 6 years earlier. While the war ended with a military defeat, it presented Sadat with a political victory that later allowed him to regain the Sinai in return for peace with Israel.[40]<br><br>

Sadat made a historic visit to Israel in 1977, which led to the 1979 peace treaty in exchange for Israeli withdrawal from Sinai. Sadat's initiative sparked enormous controversy in the Arab world and led to Egypt's expulsion from the Arab League, but it was supported by most Egyptians.[41] However, Sadat was assassinated by an Islamic extremist. Hosni Mubarak came to power after the assassination of Sadat.[42]<br><br>

In late February 2005, Mubarak announced a reform of the presidential election law, paving the way for multi-candidate polls for the first time since the 1952 movement.[43] However, the new law placed restrictions on the candidates, and led to Mubarak's easy re-election victory.[44] Voter turnout was less than 25%.[45] Election observers also alleged government interference in the election process.[46] After the election, Mubarak imprisoned Ayman Nour, the runner-up.[47]<br><br>

Human Rights Watch's 2006 report on Egypt detailed serious human rights violations, including routine torture, arbitrary detentions and trials before military and state security courts.[48] In 2007, Amnesty International released a report alleging that Egypt had become an international center for torture, where other nations send suspects for interrogation, often as part of the War on Terror.[49] Egypt's foreign ministry quickly issued a rebuttal to this report.[50]<br><br>

Constitutional changes voted on 19 March 2007 prohibited parties from using religion as a basis for political activity, allowed the drafting of a new anti-terrorism law, authorized broad police powers of arrest and surveillance, and gave the president power to dissolve parliament and end judicial election monitoring.[51] In 2009, Dr. Ali El Deen Hilal Dessouki, Media Secretary of the National Democratic Party (NDP), described Egypt as a "pharaonic" political system, and democracy as a "long term goal". Dessouki also stated that "the real center of power in Egypt is the military".<br><br>


2011-2013 revolution<br><br>

On 25 January 2011, widespread protests began against Mubarak's government. On 11 February 2011, Mubarak resigned and fled Cairo. Jubilant celebrations broke out in Cairo's Tahrir Square at the news.[53] The Egyptian military then assumed the power to govern.[54][55] Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, chairman of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, became the de facto interim head of state.[56][57] On 13 February 2011, the military dissolved the parliament and suspended the constitution.<br><br>

A constitutional referendum was held on 19 March 2011. On 28 November 2011, Egypt held its first parliamentary election since the previous regime had been in power. Turnout was high and there were no reports of major irregularities or violence.[59] Mohamed Morsi was elected president on 24 June 2012.[60] On 2 August 2012, Egypt's Prime Minister Hisham Qandil announced his 35 member cabinet comprising 28 newcomers including four from the Muslim Brotherhood.<br><br>

Liberal and secular groups walked out of the constituent assembly because they believed that it would impose strict Islamic practices, while Muslim Brotherhood backers threw their support behind Morsi.[62] On 22 November 2012, President Morsi issued a declaration immunizing his decrees from challenge and seeking to protect the work of the constituent assembly.<br><br>

The move has led to massive protests and violent action throughout Egypt.[64] On 5 December 2012, tens of thousands of supporters and opponents of president Morsi clashed, in what was described as the largest violent battle between Islamists and their foes since the country's revolution.[65] Mohamed Morsi offered a "national dialogue" with opposition leaders but refused to cancel the December 2012 constitutional referendum.<br><br>

On 3 July 2013, the military removed Morsi from power in a coup d'etat and installed an interim government.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T2">政治架构</a> </b><br>
	<hr>
	
永久宪法于1971年9月11日经公民投票通过。宪法规定埃及是“以劳动人民力量联盟为基础的民主和社会主义制度的国家”，经济上有“国家所有制、合作社所有制和私人所有制”三种形式。<br><br>

总统是国家元首兼武装部队最高统帅，由人民议会提名，公民投票选出，任期６年，任命副总统、总理及内阁部长，以及解散人民议会，在特殊时期可采取紧急措施；在人民议会（立法机关）闭会期间，还可通过颁布法令进行统治。1980年5月22日经公民投票修改宪法，规定政治制度“建立在多党制基础上”；“总统可多次连选连任”，并增加了“建立协商会议”的条文。<br><br>

人民议会是最高立法机关。议员由普选产生，任期5年。议会的主要职能是：提名总统候选人；主持制定和修改宪法；决定国家总政策；批准经济和社会发展计划及国家预算、决算，并对政府工作进行监督。<br><br>

协商会议是萨达特总统于1979年提出建立并写入宪法的。1980年11月1日，协商会议正式成立。委员共210名，其中三分之二由各阶层、机构和派别选举产生，其中一半应是工人和农民；三分之一由总统任命。根据宪法规定，协商会议是与人民议会并立存在但无立法权和监督权的咨询机构。每届任期六年，三年改选一半委员，可连选连任，亦可再次任命。协商会议设主席、副主席。<br><br>

1981年10月14日，萨达特总统于阅兵大典遭同情伊斯兰份子的士兵公然枪杀，旁边的副总统穆巴拉克侥幸躲过一劫，8天后在军队拥戴下继任总统，从此埃及一直处在紧急命令与戒严状态,直到埃及革命迫使穆巴拉克下台，军队接管政权之后才得以解除。<br><br>

自2011年1月24日开始，埃及发生了举世瞩目的埃及革命，人民普遍对时任埃及总统穆巴拉克、现行制度及生活表示不满，遂渐渐开始示威游行，要求总统下台并对埃及现行不民主的政治体系制度进行改革；期间总统表示将不退任总统一职，但不参加2011年9月总统选举竞选六连任，由于总统坚持留任并不为人民接受以及期间发生枪战人民遭枪杀，导致示威游行范围自解放广场(Tahrir Square)扩大到埃及多个省份并进行抗议、示威及静坐。<br><br>

2011年2月11日，穆巴拉克透过副总统奥马尔 苏莱曼发表离职声明，政权由埃及武装部队最高委员会接管。而前总统穆巴拉克及其近亲已搭直升机飞到距离首都开罗400公里，位于红海度假胜地沙姆沙伊赫(Sharm el-Sheikh)。<br><br>


2011年11月21日，根据外电报道，执政的军方最高委员会因政权移交速度牛步化，不满的民众再度走上街头，要求军方将政权移交给文人政府。冲突中有多名民众死亡及受伤，新冲突逐渐蔓延到全国各地，军方面临强大压力。11月24日，军方出乎预料的表达歉意，表示军方不会恋栈权位，之后的国会大选及总统选举都会如期举行。军方表示现在交出政权“违背”民众的托付，另一方面示威民众则表示，若军方不立刻下台，他们决不会离开解放广场。目前冲突虽暂时平息，但随时有可能再度发生抗争行动。<br><br>

2011年11月28日至2012年1月11日，埃及分成三个阶段进行了人民议会的选举工作，结果自由与正义党领导的埃及民主联盟获得498席中的235席，成为议会的第一大党派，极端保守的Al-Nour Party获得107席为第二大党，获得38席的New Wafd Party是第三大党。<br><br>

2012年6月14日，埃及最高宪法法院裁定人民议会选举依据的选举法违宪，因此下令解散新国会。<br><br>

2012年6月17日，武装部队最高委员会公布了修正后的《宪法宣言》，此次修改共涉及8个条款，修正案限制了总统职权[2]。<br><br>

2012年6月24日，埃及最高总统选举委员会公布，穆斯林兄弟会下属自由与正义党主席穆罕默德 穆尔西击败前总理艾哈迈德 沙菲克，赢得穆巴拉克下台后的首次埃及民主总统大选。<br><br>

8月2日，总理希沙姆 甘迪勒组建的新内阁正式上任[3]。<br><br>

8月12日，总统穆尔西对军队高层做出重大人事调整，国防部长坦塔维和军队总参谋长萨米 阿南分别由阿卜杜 法塔赫 西西与西德基 苏卜希继任；同时宣布武装部队最高委员会于6月17日通过的限制总统权力的宪法修正案无效，公布的新宪法声明从当天起生效；这项决定得到了军队的支持，此举被认为是民选政府巩固执政基础的重要一步，军官将逐渐退出埃及权力的核心，文官执政将成为埃及改革的方向[4]。<br><br>

2013年7月3日，埃及国防部发动军事政变，穆罕默德 穆尔西遭到阿卜杜勒-法塔赫 塞西为首的埃及军方罢黜，由阿德里 曼苏尔担任临时总统，军方并宣称将会提早举行国会和总统选举，与修改宪法[5]。<br><br>

The Egyptian parliament is bicameral, consisting of the Shura Council, elected for six-year terms, and the House of Representatives, whose members are elected to serve five-year terms.[79] Elections were last held between November 2011 and January 2012; elections for the House of Representatives were to be held in early 2013, but have been delayed; while election for the Shura Council are to be held within one year.[79]<br><br>

In the latest elections to the Shura Council, the Democratic Alliance for Egypt won 105 seats, the Alliance for Egypt 45 seats, the New Wafd Party 14, the Egyptian Bloc 8, while other parties and independents held 8 seats. Presidential appointees held 9 seats.[79] In the House of Representatives, the Democratic Alliance of Egypt holds 235 seats, Alliance for Egypt 123, New Wafd Party 38, Egyptian Bloc 35, Al-Wasat 10, Reform and Development Party 9, The Revolution Continues Alliance 8, National Party of Egypt 5, Egyptian Citizen Party 4, Freedom Party 4, while other parties and independents held 27 seats. SCAF appointees held 10 seats.[79]<br><br>

On 24 June 2012, Egypt's election commission announced that Muslim Brotherhood candidate Mohammed Morsi had won Egypt's presidential runoff. Morsi won by a narrow margin over Ahmed Shafiq, the last prime minister under deposed former president Hosni Mubarak. The commission said Morsi took 51.7 percent of the vote versus 48.3 for Shafiq.[80] Morsi was sworn in Saturday 30 June 2012, as Egypt's first democratically elected president.[81]<br><br>

Prime Minister Ahmed Shafik was sworn in as Prime Minister on 29 January 2011, following the resignation of Ahmed Nazif. Since President Mubarak's resignation during the 2011 revolution, Egypt's de facto government has been the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, chaired by Mohamed Hussein Tantawi.<br><br>

In 2013, the Freedom House rated political rights in Egypt at "5" (with 1 representing the most free and 7 the least), civil liberties as "5" which gave it the freedom rating of "Partly Free."[82]<br><br>

Egyptian nationalism predates its Arab counterpart by many decades, having roots in the 19th century and becoming the dominant mode of expression of Egyptian anti-colonial activists and intellectuals until the early 20th century.[83] The ideology espoused by Islamists such as the Muslim Brotherhood is present in small segments[citation needed] of the lower-middle strata of Egyptian society.[84]<br><br>

Egypt has the oldest continuous parliamentary tradition in the Arab world.[85] The first popular assembly was established in 1866. It was disbanded as a result of the British occupation of 1882, and the British allowed only a consultative body to sit. In 1923, however, after the country's independence was declared, a new constitution provided for a parliamentary monarchy.[85]<br><br>

穆罕默德 阿耶特（Mohamed Morsi, 1951年），埃及工程师、大学教授、政治家。埃及共和国第5任总统 。自从2011年4月30日开始担任埃及的伊斯兰政党-自由与正义党主席[2]。<br><br>



2012年总统选举中击败前总理艾哈迈德 沙菲克，成为埃及史上首位民主选举产生的总统[3]。2013年7月3日，穆尔西被埃及军方罢黜，共任职370天。并且暂停现行宪法，任命埃及最高宪法法院院长阿德里 曼苏尔为代总统。<br><br>


1975年穆尔西获得开罗大学的技术工程学士学位，1978年又获得该校的研究生学位。1982年他又收获了南加州大学的工程博士学位。<br><br>

1982年到1985年，他担任南加州大学的助理教授。1985年他返回埃及担任宰加济格大学的材料科学教授[4]。<br><br>

1991年他加入穆斯林兄弟会。在穆巴拉克时期他曾两次被监禁。<br><br>

2000年他以独立人士身份当选人民议会议员，任期为2000年12月1日至2005年12月12日。<br><br>

2005年他成为埃及的穆斯林兄弟会组织-Guidance Office的高级成员。<br><br>

2011年他参与了自由与正义党创建工作并担任首任主席。<br><br>


2012年3月31日，自由与正义党推举 海拉特 沙特尔 为总统候选人，不过沙特尔的资格在4月14日被选举委员会认定无效，因为他刚于2011年3月获释，这违背了选举法规定的六年前获释的人才有资格参选的内容 。<br><br>



埃及总统选举候选人登记工作2012年4月8日正式结束，共有23人报名参选。除早已寻求竞选总统的阿盟前秘书长阿姆鲁 马哈茂德 穆萨外，前总统穆巴拉克的副手、原情报局长奥马尔 苏莱曼在最后一刻正式登记，穆斯林兄弟会（穆兄会）则推出了两名候选人，分别是穆兄会副主席海拉特 沙特尔和自由与正义党主席穆罕默德 穆尔西。<br><br>

面对穆萨、苏莱曼等前政权“明星人物”的参选，以穆兄会为首的伊斯兰主义者丝毫不敢掉以轻心。由于担心沙特尔曾经遭遇司法处罚会被取消候选人资格，穆兄会还推出了自由与正义党主席穆罕默德 穆尔西参加总统选举。<br><br>

2012年5月28日，埃及最高总统选举委员会主席法鲁克 苏尔坦在开罗举行的发布会上宣布投票结果。埃及最高总统选举委员会当日宣布，穆斯林兄弟会候选人穆尔西和前总理沙菲克在总统选举第一轮投票中分获前两名，携手进入决胜轮。<br><br>

6月18日，穆斯林兄弟会称其总统候选人穆尔西在埃及总统大选中获胜。<br><br>

6月24日，埃及最高总统选举委员会主席苏尔坦宣布，穆斯林兄弟会（穆兄会）候选人穆尔西成功赢得总统选举决胜轮，成为前总统穆巴拉克下台后的首任埃及总统。苏尔坦在当天的发布会上说，决胜轮共有超过2642万名选民参与投票，投票率为51.8%，有效票约为2577万张，其中穆尔西赢得1326万多张选票，得票率为51.7%，他的对手前总理沙菲克的得票率为48.3%。<br><br>

 <a href= "pic05.html">没有伊斯兰的世界</a><br><br>
穆尔西成为埃及历史上首位代表伊斯兰势力、没有军方背景的总统。<br><br>

结果公布后坦塔维发表声明祝贺穆尔西当选，坦塔维说选举结果表明军方不偏袒任何候选人，最终的人选是由人民的意志决定的。沙菲克当晚也发表声明祝贺穆尔西，并希望他上任后的艰难使命能取得成功[7]。<br><br>

当选总统后他立即辞去了党主席一职[8]，以便更好地履行总统职务[9]。<br><br>

当地时间24日晚间，他发表了当选后的30分钟的首次电视讲话。他说，目前埃及社会正面临严重分裂，所有民众应尽释前嫌、团结一致，实现社会和解。他也表示，“我们将努力保护埃及的安全。我们尊重所有的国际条约和协议。我们已经告诉世界，我们想要和平。”[7]联合国秘书长潘基文、美国总统奥巴马、欧盟外长阿什顿、英国外长黑格、土耳其外交部、巴勒斯坦的哈马斯和法塔赫、以色列总理、伊朗等许多国家的政府等都对穆尔西的当选表示祝贺[10][7]。6月30日，他在最高宪法法院宣誓就职，承诺建立世俗、民主、法治的现代化国家。<br><br>


2012年7月8日，他颁布政令以恢复被解散的人民议会的运作，不过之后很快被最高宪法法院认定无效。为了消解他同军方的矛盾，7月12日，他发表声明称将尊重宪法法院的裁决，不再执行之前颁布的政令。<br><br>

2012年7月下旬，他任命希沙姆 甘迪勒出任总理并负责组建内阁，8月2日，新内阁正式上任[11]。<br><br>

8月12日，他命令武装部队最高委员会主席、国防部长坦塔维和军队总参谋长萨米 阿南辞职[12]；他同时宣布武装部队最高委员会于2012年6月17日通过的限制总统权力的宪法修正案无效[13]，公布的新宪法声明从当天起生效[14]。穆尔西的发言人Yasser Ali宣布，坦塔维与阿南两人将继续担任总统的顾问，两人还被授予埃及最高荣誉“尼罗河勋章”。穆尔西提名时任军事情报主管阿卜杜 法塔赫 西西担任新的国防部长，西德基 苏卜希担任总参谋长[15]，资身法官马哈茂德 梅基担任副总统。纽约时报分析称，这个事件是穆巴拉克下台以来埃及政局的一次大变动[15]。半岛电视台称这是军方和总统之间权力斗争激化的表现[13]。而路透社在一则新闻中引述军事委员会一名资深成员的话称，这“是经过咨询坦塔维和军事委员会其他成员后做出的”决定。[16]8月13日，埃及军方发表声明表示尊重和支持总统调整人事的决定，同时多个党派也表示支持总统的决定；分析人士称，穆尔西从此巩固了民选政府的执政基础，有利于政府集中精力解决国家面临的各种问题[17]。<br><br>

他于10月8日颁布大赦令，赦免从2011年1月25日至2012年6月30期间，为“支持革命”、推翻穆巴拉克政权而被捕的公民。被赦免者包括被起诉者和正在服刑者，不过涉嫌犯有谋杀罪的人不在赦免之列。有报道5000余名公民在此期间被捕。穆尔西的法律顾问称大赦令是“埃及革命最重要的胜利之一”，“显示了埃及革命力量正在行使权力，并影响国家决策，是一个保护革命成果的立法”。[18]<br><br>

11月下旬，他颁布新法令赋予总统新权力，包括可解除穆巴拉克时代的总检察长及任命新人选，这引起许多埃及人的示威抗议。反对者认为这是他想要独揽权力的象征，而穆尔西辩称这是民主改革的需要[19]。在经过连续多天的抗议反对后，穆尔西于12月8日宣布废除了上述扩权令[20]。<br><br>

2013年6月16日，他发布政令决定调任及任命17名省长，这一举动被认为是埃及省级人事调动的“大举措”。而埃及最大的反对派联盟“救国阵线”再次呼吁在6月30日（穆尔西上台执政一周年）举行大规模示威游行，以实现“恢复革命并纠正革命走向”迫使穆尔西下台并提前举行总统选举。[21]与此相对应，穆尔西的支持者们6月21日在开罗纳赛尔城集会游行声援总统穆尔西，并呼吁所有埃及人通过非暴力和平的方式表达自己的诉求[22]。6月30日，支持者与反对者同时举行大规模集会和游行活动表达各自对政府的态度，埃及媒体认为，埃及的伊斯兰派与自由派之间存在的分歧造成社会分裂和局势不稳，只有通过对话实现全国和解才能恢复政局稳定，政治稳定后才能吸引投资、发展旅游业以实现经济发展改善民生。[23]<br><br>

2013年7月3日晚间，军方首脑阿卜杜勒-法塔赫 塞西将军宣布暂停宪法，推翻穆尔西统治，并成立过渡政权[24][25]。<br><br>
在埃及军方设置的48小时解决危机最后期限到期后的数小时，埃及军方与反对派举行了会晤。2013年7月4日，埃及军方宣布进行政治过渡，罢黜总统穆尔西。[30][31]<br><br>

但是穆尔西的支持者指责称这是一场军事政变。据路透社报道，埃及军方领导人国防部长塞西7月3日晚发表电视讲话称，军方与穆尔西此前的谈判宣告失败，穆尔西7月2日的演讲没能满足人民的要求[31]。<br><br>

塞西公布了军方提出的埃及未来发展路线图，主要内容包括：暂停使用现行宪法，提前举行总统选举，最高宪法法院院长将在总统选举前暂行总统职权，成立联合政府，成立专门委员会商讨修改宪法。埃及军方已经禁止总统穆尔西及其所属的埃及穆兄会数名高层出国，埃及警方目前已下令逮捕300名穆斯林兄弟会领导人及成员。<br><br>

穆斯林兄弟会（Muslim Brotherhood） 伊斯兰复兴运动的宗教性政治组织。1928年哈桑 巴纳（Hassan al-Banna）于埃及伊斯梅利亚创立，1929年正式成立，最初，他以自己的名字命名“班纳运动”,后改为“穆斯林兄弟会”。 严格地说，这个组织并不仅是埃及独有的一个半公开、半非法组织，而是个起源于埃及、影响力遍布中东乃至全球的穆斯林群众性组织，甚至有人认为，它是近代历史最悠久、规模最大、组织最严密的、在世界范围内最具影响力的伊斯兰政治集团。<br><br>


兄弟会是一个以伊斯兰逊尼派传统为主而形成的政治团体。他们的目标在于让《可兰经》与圣行，成为伊斯兰家庭与国家最主要的核心价值。1928年出现在埃及，由一名学校教师哈桑 班纳发起[1]。穆兄会初期作为宗教性社会团体，除践行伊斯兰外，还设立了教育和医疗机构。但自影响力扩大后的1936年来，组织成为了近代伊斯兰世界出现最早的政治团体，开始反对英帝国在埃及的殖民统治。他们所推动的政治运动，形成一股风潮，扩散到许多伊斯兰国家，形成他们国家中最大的政治反对团体。<br><br>

新华国际时评:埃及政治过渡进程重回原点 <br><br>

2013年07月04日<br><br>

（记者田栋栋　李姝莛）埃及局势突现暴风骤雨式剧变。３日晚，埃及国防部长塞西联手反对派领导人与宗教领袖在开罗发表声明，公布了一份把总统穆尔西排除在外的政治路线图，宣布暂停使用现行宪法、提前举行总统选举、由最高宪法法院院长暂行总统职权。<br><br>

    这份声明实际上推翻了穆尔西领导的政府，意味着埃及在经历了长达一年的动荡与徘徊后，政治过渡进程重回原点。<br><br>

    穆尔西执政期间推动埃及制订新宪法，选举出新议会，结束了军方的“代管”，开启了政治过渡进程。有了这些“成绩”的支撑及宪法赋予的“合法性”，穆尔西才会在危机初现时底气十足，并在军方最后期限来临时拒绝辞职。<br><br>

    但面对来势汹汹的示威浪潮，穆尔西和背后的穆兄会显然低估了反对派的实力及反对穆尔西的民众的决心。更重要的是，军方突然表态打了他们一个措手不及――４８小时的最后期限将穆尔西推上绝境，军方随后更是撇开他单独与反对派和宗教界人士规划埃及未来。其实早在塞西发言前一小时，军方业已通知穆尔西“不再是国家元首”。<br><br>

    冰冻三尺非一日之寒。穆尔西今日之结局似乎早在其上台前就埋下伏笔：穆尔西在竞选之初并非穆兄会第一人选，其在该组织内部的影响力远比第一人选沙特尔逊色，上台后也只能处处受制于穆兄会，加上反对派的掣肘，没有更多精力顾及振兴经济和改善民生。一年来，埃及人民并未享受到政权更迭的实惠，这使得他们对穆尔西的不满与日俱增。<br><br>

    现实问题是，抛弃穆尔西能否就此换来埃及社会新的转机？面对“烂摊子”，新领导人能否带领埃及尽快完成蜕变？<br><br>

    事实上，埃及社会现存的矛盾并未随着穆尔西的离去而消弭。一些势力、派别之间分歧甚至仇恨依然存在，这使得埃及社会很难在短时间内实现全方位和解。<br><br>

    与此同时，埃及经济积重难返，失业率高企、外汇锐减、旅游业凋敝等穆尔西未能解决的问题依然棘手，除非新领导人能短时间内拿出切实可行的经济发展计划并得到各方全力支持，否则埃及经济很难立即触底反弹。<br><br>

    更让人忧心的是，政治上埃及又面临新的“轮回”：临时执政――重新选举――新的政治角力。况且，穆兄会在埃及的势力雄厚，会不会因为此事变而走向街头，甚至孤注一掷，依然存在变数。<br><br>

    无论如何，埃及政治家的首要任务是维护国家团结，联手各方尽早结束党派纷争与政治“轮回”，齐心协力重振埃及。只有这样，埃及的政治过渡进程才能走上正轨。<br><br>

	穆尔西：执政满一年 总统路坎坷 <br><br>

2013年07月04日   羊城晚报<br><br>

本月30日，埃及首位民选总统穆尔西执政将满一年。对于一年来穆尔西的得失与成败，埃及人看法不一，褒贬兼有。总体来看，穆尔西未能实现其竞选时提出的大部分目标，埃及的政治、经济、社会环境整体上没有明显好转。<br><br>

　　去年6月30日穆尔西宣誓就职，成为埃及首位民选总统。在穆尔西竞选期间，其最吸引选民的承诺是针对埃及社会的长期问题而提出的“百日计划”，这一计划涉及安全、能源、环境卫生、食品补贴和交通五大类的64项议题。<br><br>

　　然而，一年过去了，穆尔西提出的大部分目标仍没能完全实现，民众没有明显感觉到新政策给他们的生活带来什么积极变化。<br><br>

　　在政治方面，穆尔西及其所属的穆斯林兄弟会（穆兄会）与反对派之间的分歧非常严重，致使国家政局一直不稳；在经济和民生方面，经济开始呈现复苏迹象但本财年增速仍处于2.6%左右的低位，失业率高达13%以上，外汇储备剧减至160亿美元，通货膨胀加剧，财政赤字大增，外来投资不足。此外，与2011年初动荡前相比，社会治安状况恶化。<br><br>

　　民意调查显示，穆尔西的支持率一年来大幅下滑，去年10月时曾达到80%，目前已不足50%。<br><br>

　　对于穆尔西执政第一年的表现，埃及各种政治力量及民众看法不一。<br><br>

　　包括穆兄会以及其他一些伊斯兰派别人士在内的穆尔西支持者认为，过去一年穆尔西的表现尽管不尽如人意，但这不能全部被归咎于他，因为除缺乏执政经验外，埃及积弊甚深，要在短时间内革除这些积弊并不现实。<br><br>

　　但《金字塔报》外事局主任塔里克认为，穆尔西没有实现当初的竞选承诺，没能满足人民的需求，政绩不足。<br><br>

　　本月26日晚，穆尔西发表讲话，承认自己执政一年来存在失误，但同时指责反对势力刁难他。他的这番言论引起埃及各派的强烈反应，造成政治力量进一步分化。<br><br>

　　塔里克认为，政局稳定是解决埃及许多问题的前提，没有安全稳定的保障，吸引投资、发展旅游业等都将受到影响。但只有实现全国和解才能恢复政局稳定。<br><br>

　　因此，能否提出解决目前危机的具体措施，制定处理危机的战略方针，并在此基础上解决一系列经济、民生问题，已成为摆在穆尔西面前的艰难考验。<br><br>
新华网北京７月２日电（记者赵悦　包尔文）埃及国防部长塞西１日发表讲话说，军方为支持和反对总统穆尔西的阵营解决当前危机设置４８小时期限，若期限过后危机仍未解决，军方将进行干预，实施一个军方监管下的埃及未来路线图。<br><br>

    分析人士指出，塞西的讲话表明，在埃及前总统穆巴拉克被推翻后，通过选举产生的新总统穆尔西刚刚上任一年再次面临被推翻的危险。“民主”这一药方没能消除埃及社会的病根。这个国家或将迎来新一轮的严重动荡。<br><br>

    缘何面临“下课”<br><br>

    ６月３０日是穆尔西宣誓就职一周年纪念日。当天，数百万埃及民众在首都开罗以及亚历山大、塞得港等主要城市举行支持或反对穆尔西的大规模游行。反对穆尔西的民众要求穆尔西下台，提前举行总统选举。穆尔西的支持者则呼吁维护宪法和法律的尊严，捍卫现政权的合法性。<br><br>

    ６月３０日晚间，穆尔西的支持者和反对者在开罗穆斯林兄弟会（穆兄会）总部爆发冲突，一直持续到次日清晨。埃及卫生部１日说，６月３０日爆发游行后，全埃及死亡人数上升至１６人，另有至少７８１人受伤。穆兄会总部大楼于１日清晨被示威者占领并纵火。<br><br>

    人们不禁要问，穆尔西上台刚满一周年，为什么他的支持者和反对者就闹得不可开交，以至于他面临从总统宝座跌落的危险？<br><br>

    中东观察人士指出，从政治上看，这主要是因为穆尔西上台后在政府、议会等部门不断发展穆斯林势力，以强化管控，更顺手地治理国家。但这也同时使世俗派和其他政治势力受到挤压和排斥，造成他们的对立情绪不断加深。正因如此，在近日的抗议示威浪潮中，支持穆尔西的大多是穆斯林势力，反对穆尔西的基本上是世俗派等势力。<br><br>

    从经济上看，穆尔西执政一年来，其改善经济的举措没有“立竿见影”，特别是政局不稳导致外部援助及投资迟迟无法到位，还导致作为国家收入主要来源之一的旅游业受到重创。目前，埃及经济形势十分严峻，一些对生活不满的老百姓因此也加入示威者行列。<br><br>

    从根本原因来看，埃及眼下的尖锐矛盾也有深刻的历史渊源。前总统穆巴拉克在位后期，埃及贫富差距加大，社会矛盾激化。要消除这些差距和矛盾，一是需要时间，二是要小心谨慎，过于明显地触碰既得利益者必然会引起他们的反抗。<br><br>

    再陷动荡“漩涡”<br><br>

    从目前看，无论穆尔西下台与否，埃及社会都难以迅速恢复稳定。如果穆尔西坚持执政，那将置军方及反对者的呼声于不顾，暴力活动有可能进一步升级。埃及军方已为穆尔西设定期限，要求其满足反对派的诉求。<br><br>

    倘若穆尔西下台，则在埃及开启了通过示威活动驱赶民选总统下台的先例，这或将埃及政治推入“以暴制暴”的恶性循环。数千万穆尔西的支持者也将掀起声势浩大的抗议浪潮。<br><br>

    如果穆尔西的支持者和反对者无法在军方限定期限内找到化解危机的办法，那么就可能出现２０１１年初穆巴拉克政权刚被推翻时的情形，即由军方行使管理国家的权力。但军方接管毕竟是临时举措，下一步还要为政治过渡做准备，如进行议会选举、总统选举等活动。其间可能出现的分歧和斗争也会十分尖锐。<br><br>

    分析人士认为，如果埃及军方能够实现国家稳定，并在之后开始选举等政治进程，那么得到广大贫民支持的穆斯林势力依然有机会再次掌权，“翻版”的穆尔西上台后，埃及的社会矛盾将如何发展难以预测。<br><br>


中新网7月4日电 埃及局势相隔两年后再度陷入混乱，美国将扮演何种角色引人关注。香港《文汇报》4日发表分析文章认为，美国既对埃及总统穆尔西的民选身份投鼠忌器，但又要顾及军方利益，更要面对世俗派示威者的压力，恐怕难以采取实际行动左右埃及政局。 <br><br>

美国与埃及军方的关系可追溯至1979年埃及与以色列媾和之后。自此，美国一直扶植埃及军方，美国军校培育一代又一代埃军将领，令埃军成为美国中东布局的重要棋子。无论是穆巴拉克执政30年，还是先进的民主选举时期，美国在埃及利益代表始终是军方。<br><br>

但埃及如今形成三大权力核心：势力依然庞大的军队；习惯发声的世俗派民众；以及最棘手、人数最多的一派──一直受穆巴拉克打压的穆斯林势力，以及他们一人一票选出的民选总统穆尔西。 <br><br>

这令美国陷入极端两难局面，军方借“人民诉求”之名推翻穆尔西，将重挫一向声称要推动中东民主的美国总统奥巴马。但奥巴马又不能坐视埃军势力被削，美国过去两天均未公开谴责军方最后通牒，便是最佳证明。 <br><br>

这又凸显了一个问题：为何奥巴马没与穆尔西打好关系？问题症结在于，穆尔西和支持者都属于穆斯林兄弟会。穆兄会是逊尼派原教旨主义的一支，“基地”组织前头目本 拉登年轻时也曾是穆兄会成员。穆巴拉克及沙特阿拉伯等逊尼派美国盟友长期打压穆兄会，担心其一旦掌权，将推翻世俗派势力，这成为奥巴马不愿与穆尔西打交道的原因。<br><br> 

分析称，一边是解放广场上不满奥巴马站在穆尔西一方的世俗派声音，一边是不能割舍的军方势力，一边是通过合法民选取得权力的穆兄会，奥巴马面对三大势力角力，也只能等待听天由命。<br><br>

军方势力过于庞大，平民政治无处容身<br><br>

作者赵山河<br><br>

11月22日，埃及总统穆尔西发表新宪法声明，规定总统有权任命总检察长，强调在新宪法颁布和新议会选出之前，总统发布的所有总统令、宪法声明、法令和政令均为最终决定，任何方面无权更改。这份声明在埃及引发了示威浪潮，反对派民众连日来纷纷抗议穆尔西扩张权力。<br><br>

实际上，这次斗争不仅是穆尔西与埃及司法系统之间的冲突，更透射出这个国家的平民政治和威权统治之争的漫长历史沿革。<br><br>

在埃及的历史上，民主与军人干政理念之间有着长久的争执和博弈，从某种意义上说，埃及今天的境遇与其60年前的历史有着奇妙的相互映衬。<br><br>

1952年7月一个闷热的夜晚，在亚历山大城海滨的夏宫里，嗜赌成性的埃及国王法鲁克与富有的上层社会名流正在玩赌牌游戏，突然，他被匆匆叫去接电话。电话是他的首相侯赛因 希利打来的，告诉他说，一小撮持异见的陆军军官正在策划政变。在问明了这些阴谋分子的身份后，法鲁克哈哈一笑，只说了一声“一帮乌合之众”，随即又回到了赌桌旁。<br><br>

就在接到关于政变密谋电话后的第二天上午，法鲁克又任命了一位新首相，同时还任命自己的内弟出任国防大臣，要求他采取行动，把那些阴谋造反的人一网打尽。随后，他便返回了海滨。7月22日晚，忠于他的将军们如期赶到开罗的陆军总部开会，部署落实行动计划。<br><br>

密谋造反的军官们获悉当局镇压行动已是迫在眉睫，于是决定先发制人，提前行动。3年来，他们秘密策划，在军队内部建立起一个地下网络，称作“自由军官组织”，旨在创建一个全新的政治制度。起初，他们的基本宗旨是将英国的军事存在赶出埃及，但后来，他们越来越认识到，法鲁克已经和英国人一样，成了老牌帝国主义利益的代言人，从而明确了同样要推翻法鲁克及其王朝的必要性。<br><br>

得知法鲁克的将军们正在陆军总部开会，自由军官组织决定趁机立即对这座建筑物发动攻击。<br><br>

纳赛尔率领起义部队冲进了陆军总部。经过一番象征性抵抗，将军们很快便缴械投降了。到了7月23日凌晨时分，自由军官组织已经控制了电台、电报局、警察局和政府办公大楼。<br><br>

从历史学角度看，1952年军人政变带来的变化颇具戏剧性：它不仅终结了由法鲁克的曾祖父穆罕默德 阿里建立的长达140年历史的土耳其王朝，而且意味着，自25个世纪前波斯人征服埃及以来，埃及的统治权第一次落到了埃及人自己手中。<br><br>

可是在当时，人们对发动政变的自由军官组织几乎闻所未闻。自由军官们往往在夜间赶往尼罗河上一座小岛，在法鲁克的游艇码头开会，对自己的身份一直保持秘而不宣。<br><br>

因此，面对如此未曾预料到的顺利的政变，自由军官组织深深感到了自己在埃及影响力的微弱――在当时，自由军官组织最上层的9个主要领导人的平均年龄只有33岁。于是，为了稳住在埃及势力庞大的军方，为自己的行为塑造合法性，他们抬出了纳吉布。<br><br>

纳吉布在当时是一位53岁的高级军官，温和宽厚，因其在1948年第一次中东战争中的表现而被誉为战斗英雄，在埃及拥有广泛的影响力。1952年7月23日早晨7时，自由军官组织通过无线电广播发布的第一份夺权胜利公告，就是以穆罕默德 纳吉布的名义发布的。政变胜利之后，纳吉布被自由军官组织推举为军队总司令兼政府总理，而后来叱咤风云的自由军官组织的实际领导人纳赛尔当时还只是内政部长。<br><br>

而至于政变成功后需要开展哪些后续工作，自由军官组织并没有任何具体的计划。在德高望重的纳吉布的指导下，埃及的政变后政权从实施稳妥有序的改革措施入手，启动了新政。他们把法鲁克王朝集团分子看管了起来，宣布废除“帕夏”、“贝依”等奥斯曼帝国旧的称号，推行了一项温和的土地改革计划，以限制占有全国一半以上可耕地的富有阶层所拥有的土地面积。军官们声称，他们所要求的只是对政府发挥监督作用，一旦各政党肃清了腐败贵族，今后将实行议会选举。<br><br>

然而，施政6个月后，自由军官组织――此时已改称“革命指导委员会”（简称“革指委”）开始强化自己的控制权，排斥和清除所有异己，为建立一个军人独裁政权奠定基础。他们废止了旧宪法，禁止政党活动，没收了各政党的资金和资产。成百上千的军官、职业外交官、政府官员、大学教授以及政治家，只要与法鲁克时代有些许牵连，无一例外地遭到撤职。工会、学生组织、媒体、行业团体和宗教组织同样也都在清洗内部异己分子。1953年6月，革指委废黜君主制，宣布建立共和国，纳吉布又被推选为埃及共和国总统、总理兼革指委主席。但此时羽翼渐丰的革指委已经占据了埃及内阁的绝大部分职位，纳赛尔虽然只是副总理，却已经显露出对于内政事务强大的掌控能力。与此同时，革指委也越发表露出长期掌控政权的意图。为动员群众支持，他们发起了自己的政治运动组织――解放大会，纳赛尔出任总书记，从幕后走向了前台。<br><br>

此时，已经对革指委之前的激进行为多有不满的纳吉布在围绕如何实现革命目标的问题上与革指委开始了剧烈的摩擦。纳吉布认为军方应该逐步弱化对政治的影响力并使国家回归平民政治，同时坚持军队的职责不应该是掌控国家，反而应该是确保平民政治对于国家权力的掌握。<br><br>

正如纳吉布在其后来出版的自传《埃及的命运》中所写道的：“36岁的纳赛尔感觉，我们可以无视埃及共和的宗旨直到完成我们的目的，但53岁的谨慎的我认为，我们的政策需要草根阶层的支持，即使意味我们的某些目标会因此而被推迟。在如何去完成目标的方法上，我与这些年轻的军官们的意见难以调和。”<br><br>

与纳吉布的意见恰好相反，血气方刚的纳赛尔认为任何形式的推广民主或是军队在国家政治生活中的退出，都会导致已经在1952年政变中失去地位的政治派别卷土重来。另外，虽然在纸面上，身兼埃及总统和总理的纳吉布拥有着巨大的权力，但在实际上，他所发布的任何政令都需要革指委中的多数通过，而在这个过程中，他的意见经常被忽视。于是，被摆在台前的纳吉布越来越成为革指委其他军官们的傀儡，只是在按照纳赛尔的旨意表演。最后，无能为力的纳吉布不得不面临两个选择：要么获得真正的权力，要么辞职。<br><br>

但令人意想不到的是，还没有等到纳吉布做出最后的决断，已经目空一切的革指委突然率先发难。1953年底，纳赛尔指控纳吉布支持不久前被废止法律地位的穆斯林兄弟会并且怀有独裁的野心。一场夺取埃及军队和国家的简短权力斗争开始了，结果可想而知，纳赛尔赢得了这场政治斗争的胜利，并且成功迫使纳吉布同意将于1954年11月辞去总统职务。<br><br>

1954年2月，迫不及待的革指委宣布纳吉布辞去埃及的总统一职。公告中说纳吉布“意图获得绝对的权威，但并没有被认可”。听闻德高望重的纳吉布辞职的消息，埃及街头迅速爆发大规模游行示威，这场群众运动使得纳吉布在第二天又官复原职。但即便如此，纳吉布掌权的日子也屈指可数了。在这之后，纳赛尔正式成为埃及总理和革指委主席，纳吉布的职位只剩下了一种空洞的外壳。1954年11月14日，早已身心俱疲的纳吉布正式辞职，并于此后被软禁在开罗郊区一座别墅内，直到1972年萨达特继任总统才恢复自由。<br><br>

地区“稳定器”失灵对谁都不好 <br><br>
 
本报驻埃及记者  黄培昭  本报驻美国记者  王  恬 <br><br>
2011年01月28日 人民网-《人民日报》 <br><br>

近几日，埃及各地游行示威引发冲突，造成局势混乱，成了世界媒体关注的焦点。埃及政府1月26日宣布禁止游行示威，并强调不允许任何人凌驾于法律之上，将对破坏国家安全和社会稳定的肇事者绳之以法。中东媒体普遍认为，埃及发生的一切是突尼斯式“茉莉花革命”外溢效应的体现。西方国家在某种意义上助长了埃及国内的反政府示威活动，让反对派在客观上得到了声援。<br><br>

　　首都局势开始趋于平静<br><br>

　　首都开罗27日的局势比较平静，军警加强了戒备，主要街道上到处可以看到警车和维持秩序的军警人员。而在东北部城市伊斯梅利亚，发生了数百人的示威游行，并与警察产生零星冲突。<br><br>

　　有很多埃及人认识到，埃及作为地区形势“稳定器”，失灵了对谁都不好。所以，开罗等地25日出现了支持政府的游行。游行者打出“不要1月25日革命”、“反对破坏”和“我们热爱埃及”等标语，与反对派的游行形成对峙。<br><br>

　　本报记者在现场采访了一位名叫阿姆鲁的出租司机，他认为埃及不会发生突尼斯那样的变化，埃及总统穆巴拉克的统治能力要比本・阿里强很多。阿姆鲁说，像游行示威这种做法“基本上是胡闹”，因为埃及社会本身的惯性太大了。他说，穆巴拉克在外交上“很好”，得到了国际社会的广泛认可，不过在处理内部事务，尤其是发展经济等方面“不太行”，物价高涨和官员腐败等都令人头疼。不过，也有不少人是为了凑热闹，有些人则是唯恐天下不乱，趁机搞破坏。<br><br>

　　埃及是一个乱不起的国家<br><br>

　　埃及反对派的报纸多认为局势处于“动荡”中，形势发展不可预测。反对党下属的《华夫脱日报》26日评论说，埃及需要一场彻底的变革，穆巴拉克和他的家族不能再统治下去了，现在正是通向这一变革的第一步。<br><br>

　　埃及多数媒体则认为，政府有能力控制局面，因为埃及是一个需要稳定的国家。《金字塔报》27日指出，国家的利益高于一切，任何人都不能触及国家利益这条红线。《共和国报》27日评论说，包括政治诉求在内的一切要求都可以通过和平的方式来表达，而不是现在通过极端和暴力的方式。<br><br>

　　埃及不少学者认为，埃及是一个乱不起的国家。仅在游行的第一天，埃及股市的交易额就损失了40亿美元，下跌15%。埃镑对美元的比价也跌到6年来的最低值。《消息报》27日分析认为，埃及一乱，国外的投资会立即撤资，从而对埃及经济产生不可估量的负面影响。《金字塔报》27日头版报道指出，巴林国王打电话给穆巴拉克，强调埃及不能乱，因为埃及是阿拉伯国家具有象征和代表意义的一员，埃及乱局将波及整体阿拉伯甚至是中东地区。<br><br>

　　美国重申埃及是亲密盟友<br><br>

　　其实，乱局也不是美国所愿意看到的。因为埃及动乱会影响到美国在阿拉伯国家和中东地区的切身利益。正如黎巴嫩《使者报》26日评论所称，美国等西方国家对埃及的心态很矛盾，一方面是希望埃及变革和民主的早日到来，另一方面，埃及“真正民主了”，如果极端势力和宗教党派上台，那么美国与埃及的关系将受到损害。因此，突尼斯“茉莉花革命”后，西方一度猜测埃及等国会产生连锁反应，但现在又担心埃及政局发生不测，从而给自己产生影响。<br><br>

　　美国白宫发言人吉布斯1月26日重申埃及是美国的“亲密与重要盟友”，美国正“紧密跟踪埃及以及突尼斯的形势”。国务卿希拉里・克林顿27日呼吁埃及各派“保持克制”，避免使埃及出现暴力和混乱。《纽约时报》26日头条消息题为“一个地区的动荡搅乱美国外交政策”，认为埃及和突尼斯等国的游行示威给美国外交政策带来挑战。文章称，美国政府官员近日接受访问时承认，美国对中东地区各方的影响力有限。<br><br>

　　从目前的情形来看，美国政府在密切关注埃及形势的同时，正采取一种“双轨”策略。即一方面与反政府力量进行接触，一方面向埃及政府施压，要求埃及政府进行“政治改革”。美国因此有评论认为，在“专制主义盟友的稳定”与“民主变化的不确定”之间，美国政府更倾向于选择前者。不过也有分析认为，相较于奥巴马上任第一年对民主人权议题采取的“实用主义做法”，人权议题目前在其外交政策中的地位呈现上升趋势。<br><br>

	<hr>
	
穆尔西宣布撤换军方高层的消息甫一发出，世间一片哗然。专家、学者纷纷站队，对这一“出乎意料”之举的看法分为截然相反的两派。悲观派大呼穆尔西太急太“嫩”，做出如此大胆冒进的决策，将很不利于埃及的平稳政治过渡；而乐观派则为穆尔西主动出击、一夜之间扭转“软弱”形象竖起大拇指，称其有“虎口夺食”的英勇和谋略。<br><br>

     解读<br><br>

    妥协or决裂？<br><br>

    自撤换军方高层消息发出后，截至记者发稿时，军方并无任何回应。这就为事实的真相蒙上一层面纱。这个决定，究竟是事前协商所得，还是穆尔西铤而走险、“虎口拔牙”？<br><br>

    乐观派：卫报发表评论，称这个决定是穆尔西与埃及武装部队最高委员会（SCAF）协商的结果，坦塔维正是该委员会核心成员，而且新任命的国防部长等人也是SCAF成员。<br><br>

    两名继任者阿卜杜勒 法塔赫 塞西和西德基 苏卜希均是武装部队最高委员会成员。美联社解读，这可能表明军方许可穆尔西撤换坦塔维和武装部队总参谋长萨米 阿南，或者意味着军方高层意见不统一。<br><br>

    而据新华社消息，武装部队最高委员会成员穆罕默德 阿萨尔告诉路透社记者：“这个决定依据（总统）与陆军司令和武装部队最高委员会其他人的磋商。”据埃及官方媒体中东通讯社报道，军方内部没有“负面反应”。<br><br>

    悲观派：部分持不同意见的分析人士判定，这标志着穆尔西和军方之间的彻底决裂。内蒙古民族大学教授王泰说，这是“穆尔西与坦塔维合作破产的标志”。自6月17日穆尔西击败前总理沙菲克，坐上埃及首位民选总统宝座后，“不确定性”、“不按常理出牌”成了外界对穆尔西执政的多数评价，曾有人预测，至少一年内穆尔西及穆斯林兄弟会会保持与军方携手合作的关系。然而穆尔西打破“预言”，执政不到两月，他一举摘掉了国防部长坦塔维、总参谋长阿南两位军方高层人物的“帽子”。王泰认为，这一连串的“大手笔”，不是当前文职政府给埃及军方一个“下马威”，而是从军方手中夺权的全面开始。<br><br>

    大胆冒进or深思熟虑？<br><br>

    纽约时报评论称，穆尔西的举措一夜之间扭转了他担任总统之前的“软弱”形象，并将之称为自穆尔西当选总统以来为巩固政权而采取的最强有力的举措。然而，有专家表示，这一决定实在太大胆、太冒进，是没有执政经验的表现，将为他本人带来很大的政治风险。<br><br>

    乐观派：英国埃克塞特大学教授Omar Ashour认为，此前穆尔西一直奉行谨慎的策略，他委任革命中的重要人物担任内阁关键职位，以掌管国家的“软实力”。而现在一系列大胆强硬的措施则表明，他开始寻求掌管国家的“硬实力”。<br><br>

    中国社会科学院西亚非洲研究所中东室研究员余国庆认为，军方近来应对西奈半岛安全局势不力，与穆尔西突然采取“夺权”行动有密切的关系。“边界局势的稳定和安全，直接影响穆尔西在民众中的声望和地位，因此穆尔西尤其重视西奈半岛问题，并想通过撤换军方高层这种‘强硬’的姿态，展现自己的执政水平。”<br><br>

    “表面看来出乎意料，其实是利用了时机恰好的国际背景。”余国庆进一步解释，目前国际上以美国为首的西方国家及世界其他地区对穆尔西的认可度越来越高，“穆尔西不是在犯傻，而是很敏锐地嗅到了这一有利时机，在这一局博弈中，显然穆尔西占据了优势。”<br><br>

    悲观派：分析师贾迈勒 苏尔坦说：“新任总统和军方（武装部队最高）委员会之间的正面碰撞不出所料，只是，没有想到这么快。”<br><br>

    中国社会科学院世界历史研究所研究员毕健康表示，这个事件本身很突然、很冒进甚至很冒险，不利于埃及的平稳政治过渡。“穆尔西太‘嫩’了。6月选举时，军方表现得很收敛，几乎是‘睁一只眼闭一只眼’让穆尔西上台，而成为总统后的穆尔西依仗的力量来源――议会，目前仍处于半解散状态，他的内阁随时可能被重新改组，谁知他却在上台不到两月之际发起一场反军方的‘政变’。”在毕健康看来，且不说夺权，穆尔西这么做是“过早摊牌”，对他自身不利，对埃及的平稳过渡更不利。<br><br>



<a href= "pic05.html">没有伊斯兰的世界</a><br><br>




    局势将恶化or夺权初告捷？<br><br>

    一些分析师认定，以撤换军方高层、收回立法权的方式，让穆尔西在与军方的权力博弈中暂时处于有利位置。而有专家则对埃及局势深表担忧，穆尔西的“鲁莽”行动轻则影响本人，重则进一步打破或加剧埃及二元对峙政治结构的不平衡，进而对穆斯林兄弟会产生不利影响。<br><br>

    乐观派：余国庆对埃及未来局势相对持乐观态度，他说：“这是穆尔西在埃及政治重建道路上迈出的重要一步。”<br><br>

    正如社会民主党创建人穆罕默德 阿布-加尔所言，“权力争斗中，军方委员会越来越弱势。军方委员会被推离权力，失去位置，这不可避免。”余国庆认为，这个行为是埃及内部的政治动向，国际社会不太可能站出来指责任何一方，而此刻相对于日前因反恐不利备受民众指责的军方，穆尔西及穆兄会的优势跃然纸上。<br><br>

    不过，也有一些分析人士表示，穆尔西和庞大牢固的埃及军方权力博弈远未结束。在埃及，大多数家庭有成员是现役军人或有过服役经历，而且军方的经济活动贡献埃及近四分之一的国民生产总值。因此，军方在埃及受到大量民众拥护，仍有不小的影响力。而穆兄会虽然在两场选举中均获胜，但它的民众基础与军方相比仍然“有限”。<br><br>

    悲观派：有观点认为，穆兄会急于推掉军方颁布的6 17宪法增补条款，发布新宪法声明，是为了控制军队以及控制反穆兄会的汹汹潮流，而且更大的忧虑是若重新选举议会，在民意不如以前的情况下，穆兄会将损失惨重。<br><br>

    “然而，关于制宪委员会成员的产生、组成及分配等问题上，军方和穆斯林兄弟会的博弈已经反反复复进行到第三波了，所以这个新宪法生命的意义不是很大，军方随时可以对此重新‘洗牌’。”持悲观看法的毕健康表示，就算新宪法产生了，它也可能是“空”的，如果军方这股强大的力量不认可它，会以各种形式将之“推倒”。<br><br>

    不仅如此，毕健康还列举了几大不利影响：进一步恶化埃及局势，不利于埃及的平稳政治过渡；其二，对于埃及政治结构而言，会进一步打破或加剧不平衡的二元对峙结构，进而对穆斯林兄弟会不利。<br><br>

	<b><a name="T6">穆尔西：从“英雄”到“恶棍”</a> </b><br>
	<hr>
	

章磊  国际周刊专稿<br><br>

    2012年初，穆罕默德 穆尔西还是个不太为埃及民众所熟悉的角色，更别说在埃及以外的全世界其他国家。尽管一直是埃及穆斯林兄弟会核心领导层的成员之一，但相比穆兄会其他更具魅力的政治或宗教领袖人物而言，穆尔西更像一个“幕后军师”，很少被外界所了解。即使是对中东局势十分关注的美国国务院，除了一些专门研究阿拉伯地区的专家和官员，其他人几乎没有听说过穆尔西这个名字。<br><br>
    到了年末，穆尔西已经成为全球最关注的焦点人物之一，不断出现在各大媒体的最显要位置。近段时间来，美国和以色列称赞穆尔西为“和平使者”、巴勒斯坦人将他称为“救星”，而其他阿拉伯世界国家已经将他视作一名国家元首。不过，自从穆尔西上月22日颁布新宪法声明后，数以万计的埃及反政府人士就开始聚集在开罗的解放广场，抗议穆尔西这种“扩张自己权力”的做法，将他称为试图施行独裁的新“法老”。短短时间，穆尔西就完成了从“英雄”到“恶棍”的转型。<br><br>

从春风得意到遭遇抗议<br><br>

    美国《时代》杂志最近对穆尔西进行了专访，随后发表文章对穆尔西作出中性评论：“无论穆尔西被认为是‘英雄’还是‘恶棍’，他始终在一片世界上最动荡不安、充满漩涡的政治水域上探索着自己的方向。”<br><br>

专访前获各方赞许<br><br>

    这次接受《时代》专访是巴以爆发冲突之后，穆尔西首次接受国际媒体的采访。在采访中，他坦诚地表示自己在任期中的表现并不完美，并表示他永远无法做到完美的地步。穆尔西指出，他领导的政府是埃及首个真正民主的政府，“那么人们能期待什么？所有事情都进展顺利？这不大可能，事实上一切都非常艰苦。 ”<br><br>
    不过，穆尔西也表示，过去的一年已经给他留下了深刻的印象。“2012年可以说是埃及民众有史以来经历的最美好的一年，”他说，“我们的确遭受了一些苦难，但一个新生的事物永远不会万事顺利，更不要说一个新生的国家。 ”<br><br>
    其实，当《时代》杂志安排这次专访时，穆尔西还可以被称为春风得意。他在调解以色列和巴勒斯坦伊斯兰抵抗运动（哈马斯）之间冲突中获得的成功，为他赢得了来自国际社会的赞许和国内民众的支持。甚至有分析人士认为，在近代没有其他阿拉伯国家的领导人能够像穆尔西那样创下如此壮举，埃及或许能够借此成为中东地区的领导者，正如前总统加麦尔 阿卜杜勒 纳赛尔在20世纪50年代取得的成就一样。<br><br>
    在国内，穆尔西也展示出了自己的政治技巧，从军方那夺得了更多的行政权利。甚至有一段时间，有观点认为穆尔西已经累积了足够的国内政治资本和国际信誉度，来实现在“阿拉伯之春”中许下的承诺。<br><br>

专访时已遭“下台”抗议<br><br>

    然而，随后穆尔西的举动开始有点过了头：他没有稳固已经从埃及民主进程中所积累的权力，而是试图获得更多。于是，当穆尔西在开罗赫利奥波利斯郊区的总统官邸接受 《时代》专访时，埃及大多数主要城市内已经再一次响起了 “阿拉伯之春”时的口号：“人民希望政府倒台！ ”这个口号曾经推翻了前总统穆巴拉克，最终让穆尔西得以登上总统的宝座；而如今矛头却对准了穆尔西领导的埃及首个民选政府。<br><br>
    更为严重的是，不仅穆巴拉克的支持者在高呼这个口号，即使是曾致力于推翻穆巴拉克的革命者也加入了这一行列。在解放广场，穆巴拉克时代的法官们与许多自由派人士聚集在一起，齐声要求穆尔西下台。“穆尔西完成了不可能的任务：他让两个意见相反的派别团结在了一起。 ”――这已经成为当前埃及国内最流行的讥讽穆尔西的一个笑话。<br><br>

“独裁”的味道让人捉摸不透<br><br>

    造成穆尔西陷入如此尴尬境地的根源就是他在上月22日发布的新宪法声明。按照穆尔西的说法，他的这些举措只是为了避免一些有政治意图的法官破坏新宪法的诞生进程而采取的临时性措施。不过批评人士却指出，新宪法声明中的某些条例让穆尔西拥有权力对可能威胁到国家安全或“阿拉伯之春”革命成果的隐患采取任何措施，这其中弥漫着一股“独裁”的味道。埃及著名反对派人士、诺贝尔和平奖获得者，穆罕默德 巴拉迪更是给穆尔西标上了“新法老”的称谓。<br><br>
    政治分析人士还指出，对于世界上其他地区和国家来说，穆尔西的举动也让局势变得含糊不清。究竟穆尔西最终会被证明是一个改革家还是一个独裁者，将对埃及和以色列之间能否维持和平的前景产生巨大的影响，而这将进一步影响整个中东地区的民主进程，甚至可能打破这个全球最不稳定地区的权力平衡。<br><br>
    对于尤其关注中东局势的美国来说，穆尔西的一举一动也牵动着他们的心。白宫一名官员表示：“我们不久就能知道穆尔西到底是怎样的领导人，当前情况对他来说是一个巨大的考验，考验他是否有能力与埃及各个利益阶层的人处理好关系。 ”<br><br>

从加州教授到埃及总统<br><br>

    穆尔西登上埃及权力最高点的道路十分特别，这一点不仅针对埃及国内，同时在整个中东地区也一样。首先是出身，穆尔西可谓是从草根阶层爬到权力最高层。其次，他是在完全不被看好的情况下，凭借着一点运气登上了总统宝座。<br><br>

与美国关系密切<br><br>

    穆尔西出生于开罗北部一个村庄的普通家庭，由于学习表现出众，他得以在20世纪70年代到80年代期间摆脱了与数以百万计埃及普通民众相似的命运，在开罗获得工程学学位后前往美国又待了7年，期间在加利福尼亚南部大学获得了材料科学博士学位，随后又在加利福尼亚州立大学诺思里奇分校担任助理教授。<br><br>
    据一名旧友透露，在加利福尼亚的岁月让穆尔西对南加州大学的校足球队产生了浓厚的兴趣，并获得了“莫”这么一个昵称。而穆尔西的5个孩子当中，有两个出生于美国并获得了美国国籍，甚至还有人开玩笑称，这两个孩子甚至有可能竞选美国总统，不过穆尔西对此一笑置之。<br><br>
    穆尔西1985年回到埃及，随后便积极投身于穆斯林兄弟会的各种活动。尽管穆兄会以对美国强烈的抵制立场而闻名，但穆尔西显然对这个自己曾经度过了好几个春秋的国家留有好感。他在接受《时代》杂志专访时就表示，自己不喜欢埃及国内民众说出“美国人与我们合不来”，认为事实并非如此。<br><br>
    回到埃及在一所大学担任教师的穆尔西，在穆兄会中的地位飞速上升。不过，当穆巴拉克去年下台的时候，尽管外界都确定埃及的新总统将从穆兄会领导层当中出现，但穆尔西的名字却很少被提及。<br><br>

凭运气当选总统<br><br>

    当穆尔西在今年以穆兄会下属的自由与正义党总统候选人参加竞选时，对手们甚至笑称穆尔西不过是个“备胎”而已――自由与正义党的首选是穆兄会副主席、百万富翁海拉特 沙特尔。不过，由于依据埃及法律，有刑事犯罪记录者不得出任公职，而沙特尔在穆巴拉克执政时期曾有两次获刑记录，选举委员会最终取消了沙特尔的资格，结果就是“备胎”穆尔西在最后期限提交了竞选申请。<br><br>
    尽管从外表上看，穆尔西是个容易讨人喜欢的慈祥形象，但他在竞选中的表现实在是不起眼：他的竞选演讲让人感到枯燥乏味；他跳过了唯一的电视辩论；甚至他的竞选广告看上去也没有让他获得更多的人气。在5月的第一轮投票中，穆尔西甚至只获得了不到四分之一的票数，不过最终他还是在穆兄会强大的影响力下以51.7%的得票率获得了胜利，登上总统宝座。<br><br>
    当上总统之后，缺乏明确授权、又没有足够的政治斗争经验和优势，种种因素让穆尔西看上去根本无法与穆巴拉克政权垮台后占着统治地位的埃及武装部队最高委员会，或者由穆巴拉克政府之指派的司法团队相抗衡。其实，在大选投票结束，结果还没有公布的时候，埃及宪法法院就曾宣布埃及议会选举结果违宪，同时授权武装部队最高委员会解散穆尔西所领导政党占据了多数席位的议会。与此同时，委员会还颁布了临时法令，赋予委员会立法权。<br><br>
    当时看来，如果武装部队最高委员会决意要摧毁穆尔西的权威，后者完全无法获得来自由派或民间政党的支持，原因在于他们对穆兄会的宗教色彩存在畏惧心理。尚未宣誓就职的穆尔西就像一个跛脚鸭。国际人权组织“人权观察”位于埃及办公室负责人赫巴 莫拉耶夫说：“我当时对他的期望可以说已经不能再低了，他似乎完全被束缚住了双手。 ”<br><br>

“跛脚鸭”展示才能<br><br>

    然而，事实证明穆尔西并不像大多数人眼中那么无能。出任总统以后，他展示出了此前一直隐藏的政治才能，尤其是在面对民众的公开场合：在解放广场发表就职演讲的时候，穆尔西解开了自己穿的夹克，向民众展示自己并不像穆巴拉克那样需要在公共场合穿防弹衣，而是真正来自人民的领导人。随后，就职不到两个月，穆尔西再次作出了让盟友和批评人士目瞪口呆的举动：他撤换了军方多位高级领导人，包括武装部队最高委员会主席坦塔维，自己出任委员会主席。<br><br>
    对于穆尔西如何完成这么一个匪夷所思的任务，一直是个谜――一些埃及人认为穆尔西与军方高层达成了浮士德式的交易，另一些人则猜测穆尔西掌握了军方高层一些不可告人的罪证。分析人士则认为，更大的可能是穆尔西采取了迂回的战术，说服渴望权力的第二等级军官协助他推翻了军方最高层。<br><br>
    随着穆尔西手中的权力逐渐增大，一些埃及国内的自由派人士以及美国政治观察家担心的情况也发生了：一个拥有宗教色彩的人掌握了人口最多的阿拉伯国家的绝对权力。<br><br>
    不过，现实中的穆尔西其实并没有展示出过多的宗教色彩，例如他并没有要求埃及的妇女或前往埃及旅游的国外游客严格遵守具有宗教色彩的着装要求。<br><br>

从为国谋利到为己谋权<br><br>

    尽管如此，穆尔西担任埃及总统仍不可避免地要遭遇面对巴以冲突这一严峻挑战。埃及的西奈半岛毗邻160万巴勒斯坦人的居住地，穆兄会又与哈马斯有着密切联系，而穆尔西本人也曾多次表达出反对以色列的观点。尽管穆尔西出任总统后维持了1979年埃及和以色列签署的和平协议，但这并不意味着当以色列与哈马斯发生冲突时，他会假装没看到。在调解巴以冲突方面的成功，让穆尔西及埃及大获赞许，但宣布新宪法声明为自己“扩权”，却招致民众的一片不满和抗议。<br><br>

巴以冲突后与奥巴马频繁通话<br><br>

    当以色列上月14日开始对加沙地带武装发起代号为 “防务之柱”的大规模军事行动后，穆尔西随即以激烈的言辞谴责了以方的行为。尽管他没有像土耳其总理埃尔多安那样将以色列称作“恐怖主义国家”，但也撤回了埃及驻以色列大使以示抗议，同时还派遣总理甘迪勒前往加沙地带“声援”。不过，穆尔西同时也留了一手：埃及情报部门依旧保持着与以色列情报机构的交流，而埃及也没有开放与加沙地带的边境允许哈马斯武装人员进入埃及或提供补给线路。<br><br>
    与此同时，穆尔西在短短几天内频繁与美国总统奥巴马通话。分析人士指出，巴以在加沙地带的冲突让这两个人有机会走得更近。埃及示威者10月袭击美国驻开罗大使馆之后，奥巴马和穆尔西也曾通过电话，不过当时奥巴马对穆尔西的不作为十分不满。而如今，两人的通话变得更加亲密：11月20日，穆尔西在凌晨2点30分左右还打电话给奥巴马，他为此也表示了歉意，而奥巴马也大度回应，宣称穆尔西可以在有需要的时候，不管是什么时间都可以打电话给他。<br><br>
    几小时以后，穆尔西再次打电话给奥巴马，而奥巴马则在两人谈话时候向穆尔西表示了慰问――他的一个姐妹因为癌症，一天前刚刚去世。穆尔西在接受《时代》专访时透露说，奥巴马当时安慰他，宣称在公众的注视下处理个人遭遇的挫折“的确不是一件容易的事”。<br><br>

带领埃及连获巨大成功<br><br>

    最终，以色列和哈马斯在埃及的斡旋下停火。政治分析人士指出，尽管看上去停火是埃及情报部门官员的功劳，但掌握决定权的其实还是穆尔西。据美国一名知情官员透露，穆尔西曾与到访的美国国务卿希拉里一起花费了75分钟时间详细探讨了巴以停火协议的细节，不仅用英语大声读出各个条款，同时还就各个细节问题提出了自己的观点，包括哪些内容他表示同意，哪些内容他认为还需要改动。<br><br>
    自由与正义党外交事务委员会负责人阿姆鲁 达尔拉格说：“在穆巴拉克执政时期，我们的情报人员也曾与以色列和哈马斯磋商，但并没有起到任何作用。这次情况不一样了，因为我们拥有了穆尔西。”分析人士指出，穆尔西没有开放边境，曾被认为可能招致国内亲哈马斯宗教人士的怨言，不过哈马斯政治领导人哈立德 迈沙阿勒对埃及的赞许最终打消了这些可能。<br><br>
    除此之外，穆尔西还带领埃及获得了另一个巨大成功：与国际货币基金组织初步达成了48亿美元贷款的协议。在穆巴拉克被赶下台以后，埃及国内的经济发展状况一直处于不理想的状态，持续走下坡路，因此这笔贷款能否成功对埃及而言至关重要。分析人士认为，国际货币基金组织的回应将确保私人投资者的信心，告诉外界埃及是个安全的投资目标。这一回应将有效削减埃及失业率，从而解决造成埃及国内示威抗议不断的主要根源问题。<br><br>

“孤注一掷”引来抗议<br><br>

       然而，就在一天后，穆尔西却给了埃及民众一个新的理由来对他提出抗议。那就是他坚持宣称上月22日发布的新宪法声明并不是为了自己争夺更多的权力，而是为了维护埃及的民主进程而采取的 “孤注一掷的手段”。不过，在反对他的埃及民众，甚至一些原先的支持者看来，穆尔西的这一举动就是为了给自己谋权，有试图成为新“法老”的嫌疑。<br><br>
    按照当前的情况看，埃及民众也不是十分确定穆尔西最终的目标到底是什么。在开罗解放广场上，支持穆尔西的人，反对他的人，以及普通路人并不好分辨。或许在一个角落，小商贩们在卖力推销着手中的烤玉米和爆米花；而在另一个角落，防暴警察却在使用催泪弹驱散用手帕遮住面部的一群年轻人。<br><br>
    而在接受《时代》专访时，穆尔西并没有对街头的抗议活动表示出太多的关注或担忧。 “埃及民众是自由的，当他们想反对总统时，就可以提高自己的声音，”他说，“我们如今已经是一个全新的埃及了。 ”<br><br>
    不过，政治分析人士却指出，当前解放广场上的示威活动表明，穆尔西若真正要让埃及拥有全新的面容，唯一的方式就是严格遵守自己的说法，尽快制定新宪法，将权力分散给总统、立法机构和司法机构。而这首先要求他将退出立宪会议的那些自由派成员重新召回。他们指出，这个任务并不简单，但对曾成功让军方高层退休的穆尔西来说也并不是没有可能。<br><br>

如果军方仍高居权力金字塔之巅，经历血与火洗礼的埃及人得到的可能仅仅是影子民主。<br><br>

阿拉伯之春的乐章，在埃及似乎到了奏响尾声的时刻。<br><br>

自去年2月推翻独裁统治30年之久的前总统穆巴拉克，16个月间，埃及经历了全民公决、下院选举、上院选举、制宪委员会推举、总统大选，期间抗议、流血、冲突也一路如影随形。<br><br>

6月18日，穆斯林兄弟会宣布，其总统候选人穆尔西（Mohamed Morsi）在17日第二轮总统选举中获胜。<br><br>

截至发稿，据埃及《金字塔报》网站统计数据，在初步统计的选票中，穆尔西得票率为52%，前总理沙菲克（Ahmed Shafik）为48%。沙菲克一方则称其以51.5％的得票率获胜。最终结果计划于6月21日公布，但埃及选举委员会一名官员表示，由于接到双方大量指责对方舞弊的申诉，最终结果公布时间可能推迟。<br><br>

如果不出现意外，穆尔西将成为埃及近60年来首位民选总统，也是“阿拉伯之春”出现变革的国家中的首位伊斯兰总统。<br><br>

“在瘟疫和霍乱之间的选择”<br><br>

现年60岁的穆尔西是穆斯林兄弟会中为数不多的有留美经历的高层，在穆巴拉克时代就以独立身份担任国会议员。穆巴拉克去年2月下台后，穆兄会4月30日成立自由正义党（FJP），穆尔西任党主席。不过，在自由正义党参与总统大选的过程中，穆尔西一开始只是“替补队员”，该党主要候选人、副主席沙特尔（Khairat El-Shater）因资质不符退选后才走到台前。<br><br>

穆斯林兄弟会发布胜选消息后，穆尔西表示，将致力于建设一个“世俗、民主、宪治”的现代化国家，愿做包括各政治派系、穆斯林及基督徒在内的所有国民的公仆，保证不会采取复仇和清算政策。<br><br>

他此前曾承诺，若当选总统，将保证埃及社会“拥有多元的政治力量”，并强调，“超人”总统的时代已经一去不复返。他说：“埃及总统代表的不是一个人，而是一种制度。”<br><br>

然而，埃及人对于看似已经到来的民主制度似乎已失去的耐心。埃及总人口约为8500万，其中5500万人有投票权。从2011年3月武装部队最高委员会就先进行议会选举还是先制定宪法举行公决时高达80%的投票率，到议会选举时投票率降至约50%，再到总统大选投票率远低于50%，埃及人在过去一年有至少29天都在投票，从期待到失望，不变的是军方仍重权在握，民生仍没有改善。最后角逐总统宝座的两位候选人，或多或少都有穆巴拉克时代的烙印：一个是宣称为真主而选、充满变数的伊斯兰主义者，一个是劣迹斑斑的军方前将领。以致不少埃及选民举行示威抵制大选，称选举如同“在瘟疫和霍乱之间的选择”。<br><br>

穆尔西获胜，一方面体现了穆兄会树大根深的影响力，即便在临时换将的情况下也能胜出；另一方面，其仅仅领先沙菲克不到5个百分点的微弱优势也表明，选民对其“温和原教旨主义”的竞选纲领并不买账，原教旨让世俗选民退避三舍，“温和”也难以满足原教旨选民的诉求。有相当一部分选民选择穆尔西，仅仅是因为不愿看到穆巴拉克的旧幕僚上台。<br><br>
<a href= "pic05.html">没有伊斯兰的世界</a><br><br>
“平和有度”的兄弟会保守派<br><br>

穆尔西1951年8月20日出生于沙克亚（Sharquia），早年获开罗大学工程学学士、硕士学位，后赴美深造，1982年获美国南加州大学工程学博士学位，毕业后在加州州立大学任副教授，1985年回到埃及扎格兹格大学（Zagazig University）任教。<br><br>

他早年加入穆斯林兄弟会，一步一步升至最高决策机构“指导办公室”（Guidance Office）成员、发言人，曾两次被当局监禁。由于穆巴拉克时代穆兄会成员被禁止参政，穆尔西2000年-2005年以独立候选人身份任埃及国会议员，后谋求连任失败。<br><br>

在担任国会议员期间，他因敢于直言而受到赞誉：曾号召调查对2002年火车相撞、政府枪杀反对派等事件，但是收效不大。<br><br>

2011年4月30日，穆兄会成立自由正义党，穆尔西当选党主席。据称他“平和有度”，深得党内保守派主流势力的支持。<br><br>

从教育出身看，穆尔西背景良好，有留美经历，不过只有纯工科背景；从执政经验上看，他政治阅历丰富，与上届政府和军方并无瓜葛，但是也很可能将伊斯兰团体利益置于国家利益之上，并在新起草的宪法中有所体现；在经济政策上，他倡导建立自由市场经济，推行私有化，吸引外资；在外交政策上，他在巴以冲突中声讨以色列，但穆尔西四个子女全部为美国籍，再考虑到美埃长期以来的盟友关系，其对美政策或难有所改变。<br><br>

穆尔西的穆斯林兄弟会背景是助他登上总统宝座的最大推力，但也是引发外界担忧的最主要因素。<br><br>

在埃议会下院选举中，自由正义党获232席，占498个直选议席中的46%，沙拉菲派的“光明党”获113席，占23%，二者合计原教旨派别共占69%的议席；在上院选举中，自由正义党获得106席，占180个直选议席的59%，光明党获43席，占23.9%，二者合计原教旨派别共占直选议席82.9%；在制宪委员会100人名单中，50人来自各界代表，另50人来自议会，其中自由正义党占25名，光明党11名。<br><br>

穆兄会及原教旨派别如此不俗的表现令各方忧虑：温和穆斯林派系、世俗政治派系和科普特基督徒团体，均担心埃及将“在民主外衣下走向原教旨专制”，而军方则担心原教旨派别以合法、民主的方式一步步夺取实权，瓜分利益。<br><br>

为平息外界的担忧，穆尔西努力争取年轻、自由派和基督徒选民，他一再强调，尽管自己有来自穆斯林兄弟会的背景，但未来埃及将成为一个“民主、文明和现代的国家”。<br><br>

“未来，埃及社会将没有紧急状态法，没有无故的抓捕。”他说，“年轻人有足够的自由，虽然他们同时也要承担相应的责任。”<br><br>

穆尔西强调自己领导下的将是一个“广泛的联合政府”，其选出的总理并不一定来自穆斯林兄弟会或者自由正义党。他还表示，若有可能，自己还将命名一位科普特基督徒做总统顾问，甚至是副总统。<br><br>

对于穆兄会来说，尽管有多年秘密活动的经验，但是真正走到台前，领导正在变革中的埃及也绝非易事。尤其是埃及革命后穆兄会内部斗争不断，在不少议题上对外都难以形成统一声音，又在与军方的不断妥协中失去了与自由派的信任，支持率已不如前。<br><br>

“枪杆子里面出政权”<br><br>

在后穆巴拉克时代，埃及的民主进程主要由军方、伊斯兰主义者、穆巴拉克旧幕僚三股势力相互角力。而埃及人逐渐发现，穆巴拉克的倒下仅仅意味着一个腐败政府的结束。军方已成为埃及政坛最主流、也几乎是惟一的力量，完全不受约束。对于穆尔西而言，在军权统治强势回归的时代，如何展开与军方的博弈将是最大的难题。<br><br>

用“枪杆子里面出政权”来形容埃及的军政关系再贴切不过。1952年，一群年轻的埃及军官在纳赛尔的领导下推翻了法鲁克王朝，结束了长达一个半世纪的英法殖民统治，自此占据了国家权力核心。<br><br>

正如在许多后殖民地时代的贫困国家发生的一样，纳赛尔们迅速被贴上现代派和英雄主义的标签，备受民众爱戴。军队的势力逐步渗透至埃及政治、经济、社会各方面。<br><br>

1952年后，埃及的三任主要领导人――纳赛尔、萨达特、穆巴拉克，都出身行伍，退役将军们也在政府中出任高官。与土耳其和巴基斯坦强大的带有政治色彩的军队一样，埃及军队还控制了从军火到生活必需品的重要工业以及制造业。<br><br>

在埃及革命前的政治体系中，总统大权在握。埃及民众要求的、经自由选举产生的议会和改组后的政府将会削弱总统的作用，公开选举亦将致使议会中的新兴商界精英获权，这意味着军队在经济上的力量被削弱。<br><br>

埃及军方正在用铁腕政策避免这些情况的出现：6月14日，埃及最高宪法法院宣布裁决，解散违宪议会、议会职责由军方代行。就在穆斯林兄弟会宣布穆尔西获胜之前的几个小时，武装部队最高委员会发布宪法补充声明，宣布新一届人民议会选举产生前，该委员会将行使立法权；修改宪法第56款，将立法权和国家预算决定权移交给埃及武装部队最高委员会，新总统将无权干涉；修改第30款，规定新总统宣誓就职前必须得到最高宪法法院的认可，而非议会；新总统在未取得军方同意条件下，没有权力宣布发动战争。<br><br>

这也意味着，新当选的总统穆尔西只具有任命副总统、组阁以及起草法案和预算案等基本权力，只有经军方授权才具备调动军队平定国内动乱权力。<br><br>

这一系列宪法修订条款被不少分析家称作是民主的倒退、军权独裁的开始。更有人将其与土耳其1980年为军事统治铺平道路的军事政变、阿尔及利亚1991年军方解散议会引发数年内战相提并论。<br><br>

尽管埃及武装部队最高委员会6月18日表示，军方将在6月30日前向当选总统移交权力，新总统将“享有全部总统权力”，但许多埃及人都视此为穆巴拉克式的空口承诺。<br><br>

根据现有规定，在新总统就职后的至少4个月内，武装部队最高委员会仍将掌握国家的诸多权力。在此期间，埃及制宪委员会将起草新宪法，还将选举产生新议会。<br><br>

革命热情已渐渐耗尽的埃及民众也许此时将发现，标靶式的独裁者倒下了，旧势力的金字塔依然屹立不动；被贴上民选总统标签的穆尔西很可能将只是一副“空架子”，过去16个月以来由军方领导的向民主过渡很可能徒有其名――与埃及历史上屡次发生的情况一样，军方在动荡时期出山掌权，在过渡期结束后退居幕后，大权依旧在握。<br><br>

随着新总统的选出，军方与穆斯林兄弟会的博弈也将达到新的节点：一方有变革愿景而无实权，一方不放权且无改革意愿，埃及人的民主梦想依然遥远。在中东北非激发起无数变革理想的这场革命，改变的可能只是权力的一张假面。<br><br>

6月18日，埃及大选落幕。穆斯林兄弟会抢先宣布穆尔西胜利当选，前总理沙菲克阵营对此不予承认，并指控对手操纵选民破坏选举。两派争执不休之际，军方宣布收回立法权和财权，并规定总统在重大问题上必须请示军方。<br><br>
18日，埃及大选落幕，但远未尘埃落定。深陷舞弊传闻的穆斯林兄弟会抢先宣布穆尔西胜利当选，前总理沙菲克阵营对此不予承认，并指控对手操纵选民破坏选举。两派争执不休之际，军方宣布收回立法权和财权，并规定总统在重大问题上必须请示军方。分析人士深表担忧，舞弊、党派纷争使埃及经历着变革带来的阵痛，而阵痛引发的乱局则将埃及慢慢推向军人政权的悬崖。<br><br>

埃及军方补充宪法声明<br><br>

1.埃及武装部队最高委员会掌握立法权和安排财政预算权力，直到新议会产生。<br><br>

2.无埃及武装部队最高委员会同意，总统无权宣布战争状态。<br><br>

3.无埃及武装部队最高委员会同意，总统无权动用军队平定国内动乱。<br><br>

4.埃及武装部队最高委员会有权委任新制宪委员会成员。<br><br>

穆兄会得票率暂领先<br><br>

18日早晨，埃及大选第二轮结束仅几小时，穆斯林兄弟会便抢在官方结果发布前宣布，穆尔西胜利当选总统。穆兄会官员艾哈迈德表示，全国97.7%投票站的计票结果显示，穆尔西获得1274.3万张选票，其竞争对手、前总理沙菲克获得1184.6万张选票。<br><br>

但这一声明遭到沙菲克阵营强烈质疑，他们认为全国97.7%投票站计票结果这一说法实属荒唐，大选结果要到21日才公布。沙菲克阵营还谴责穆兄会舞弊并操纵选民，“穆兄会花费大量金钱贿赂选民给穆尔西投票，并且还用暴力威胁沙菲克的支持者”。第二轮大选开始后，穆兄会便被爆出向选民提供“问题笔”（这种笔的墨水几小时后会消失）以篡改投票记录。<br><br>

据《金字塔报》最新统计数据显示，穆尔西的得票率为52%，沙菲克为47%。中东媒体评论员埃文 希尔认为，军方解散议会的举动会使一些中间选民倾向于投票穆尔西。穆兄会政治顾问阿纳斯 阿尔卡萨斯认为，军方解散议会后，没有人再能指责穆兄会独霸议会了。<br><br>

军方收权乃改革倒退<br><br>

为了回应党派政治和原教旨主义的批评，18日宣布胜选后，穆尔西对外表示所有埃及国民都是他的“家人和朋友”，他保证上台后不会采取复仇和清算政策，所有人都将依法享受平等权利。<br><br>

观察员约兰德 卡奈尔称，如果穆兄会当选总统，埃及将面临军方与政府无休止的争斗。17日，就在第二轮大选结束后当晚，军方另一重磅政令再次给穆兄会当头一棒。埃及武装部队最高委员会宣布新人民议会选举产生之前，该委员会将行使立法权。就在两天前埃及最高宪法法院刚刚宣布解散穆兄会主导的议会。<br><br>

虽然军方于18日再次保证会于6月底向民选总统移交权力，但埃及政治偶像、前国际原子能机构主席巴拉迪称，军方收权是埃及改革进程最大的倒退。<br><br>

因为根据这条政令的规定，新当选的民选总统只具有任命副总统、组阁以及起草法案和预算案等基本权力。军方却严格限制总统调动军队的权力，总统虽身为国家安全委员会首脑，但无军方授权，不具备调动军队平定国内动乱权力。<br><br>

党派纷争分裂选民<br><br>

评论员埃文 希尔认为，本次大选使埃及政局两极化，两派的愤怒使他们非常恐惧对方当选，因此无论谁当选都不能使埃及人真正享受选举的快乐。许多投票者表示投票人只是不想让另一派当选而已。沙菲克竞选团队工作人员卡兹姆 阿达维亚无奈地说，“这场选举分裂了埃及人，甚至是家庭，叔叔和侄子竟然为投票分歧在投票站扭打在一起。”<br><br>

几个月来政治争斗的龃龉消磨着埃及人的选举热情，据埃及大选观察团表示，相比五月份的第一轮选举，第二轮选举的投票率远低于第一轮，第一轮时46%的埃及合法选民参与投票。据穆兄会组织者称，直到上周日中午，投票率甚至不超过10%。大选观察团则表示，投票率可达到40%，但即便如此，这意味着埃及首任民选总统的支持者只占总人口的1/9。<br><br>

分析人士称，如此低的投票率是穆兄会希望看到的，中间摇摆选民的缺席将使前总理沙菲克的选票大量流失。难怪沙菲克阵营工作人员卡兹姆 阿达维亚激动地说，“我不责怪候选人，我只怪那些不来投票的人。”（天行）<br><br>

军方声明给埃及大选这个历史性的胜利者浇了盆冷水。――《金融时报》<br><br>

这份修正案会根据当选总统者而截然不同，若是沙菲克当选，那么军方赋予沙菲克的权力会非常大，并继续出动军队维持社会治安；若是穆尔西当选，那么军方会缩小其权限，并任由社会治安恶化下去，以激起民众不满。<br><br>

――《金字塔报》<br><br>

埃及军方将自己设定成了民选政治的对立面，忘记了自己曾经与民选政客一同带领国家从混乱走向民主。<br><br>

分析<br><br>

“新总统是军方橡皮泥”<br><br>

军方频频出招，埃及大选前途暗淡，对此本报记者采访了中国现代国际关系研究院中东专家田文林，他指出埃及军方在法律框架内的这些做法可谓棋高一招，巧妙制衡势力扩张的穆兄会，从而保持军队对政权的控制。<br><br>

穆兄会宣布胜选抢占民情<br><br>

对于军方此前解散议会的举动，田文林认为埃及虽是总统制国家，但若无议会，总统发布命令的权威性和执行力都会大打折扣，这正是军方希望看到的结果。军方无疑会是此次博弈的获胜方。<br><br>

田文林指出，新总统对于拥有立法权的军方来说，就是一块橡皮泥，可以根据需要捏成各种形状。若穆尔西上台，军方会通过合法手段限制其权力，让他无法施展；而若沙菲克当选，则会使沙菲克推行政策顺利实施，从而左右埃及局势。<br><br>

穆兄会面对如此局面不会坐视不理，提前公布穆尔西获胜就是回应。田文林分析说，在信息传播中，民众总是先入为主，穆兄会提前宣布穆尔西获胜，先声夺人让民众认为选举结果已成定局，在情感上主导民众接受穆尔西获胜，即便沙菲克胜选，也会让民众产生质疑，影响民众对大选公平性的看法。<br><br>

穆兄会军方冲突可能致内战<br><br>


而针对如此局势，埃及军方似乎早有对策，在投票期间爆出的问题笔传闻，不排除是有预谋的行为。若是穆尔西上台，埃及军方可能希望通过小事激化矛盾，重新大选，推翻新总统，维持军方自身的政治利益。<br><br>

穆尔西与沙菲克对决实质是与穆巴拉克派系对决。这也投射到民众对候选人态度上，有人支持沙菲克的观点，恢复穆巴拉克时代秩序，适当变革；也有人对前政权深恶痛绝，支持穆兄会彻底“去穆巴拉克化”。<br><br>

田文林认为，如此发展趋势会导致埃及民众陷入两难的抉择，沙菲克支持者和穆兄会拥趸的争端和冲突会从新总统上任开始升级，这可能导致埃及真正意义上的动荡，严重的话会演变成“阿尔及利亚内战”（上世纪90年代，原教旨主义政党在阿尔及利亚大选中获胜，但军方不予承认，由此引发内战）。<br><br>

军方真能决定埃及的命运？ <br><br>

2013年07月04日  新华网<br><br>


 穆尔西称自己仍是埃及合法总统 7月3日晚，支持穆尔西的民众手举穆尔西的海报在埃及开罗郊区东部奈斯尔城街头参加示威活动。埃及国防部长塞西3日晚发表全国电视讲话，宣布提前举行总统选举，由最高宪法法院院长暂行总统职权。穆尔西3日深夜通过半岛电视台发表讲话，称自己仍是埃及的合法总统。有埃及当地媒体报道，穆尔西目前已经转移到秘密处所。新华社发 <br><br>

    新华网北京7月4日电（记者 高菲）埃及政局又发生动荡，引起世人关注。美国外交政策杂志2刊登题为《马上之人》的文章，说埃及的国家命运掌握在军人手中，但是军队未必能恢复国家秩序。文章主要内容编译如下。<br><br>

    埃及的国防部长阿卜杜勒 法塔赫 塞西将军已是整装待发，却不知前往何方。7月1日，他向埃及文官政府发出最后通牒，要求其在48小时内“满足人民的诉求”，否则，军方将进行干预，为埃及未来实行“路线图”。<br><br>

    真是此一时，彼一时。2011年2月总统胡斯尼 穆巴拉克下台后，陆军元帅穆罕默德 侯赛因 坦塔维对武装部队最高委员会(SCAF)的领导不力，导致悲剧的结果：军队的支持率一直不断下降。<br><br>

    然而，军队时来运转。4至5月的佐格比民意调查显示，军队享有94%的支持率。相比之下，穆尔西的支持率一直在急剧下滑，其支持率从57%下降到28%。<br><br>

    军队飙升的人气，似乎足以让赛西迫使来自穆斯林兄弟会的总统穆罕默德 穆尔西屈服。<br><br>

    但是塞西将军将如何使用军队的影响力？他向往经典的“马背上的官员”的角色，直接管理国家。为了避免被人误会，7月1日，他的发言人在短短几个小时内快速“澄清”， 军队无意发动政变，夺取政权。然而，这产生了一个问题：军队将如何实施其政治复苏“路线图”。毕竟，武装部队最高委员会的经历给了军官团一个明确的教训表明：直接的政治行动最好留给别人来做。<br><br>

    军队的作用和目标模糊不清，当然是有意为之，目的是让对手处于不利的地位。然而，更有可能的是，反映出赛西的真正困境：挽救国家之时，如何在不消弱手中的权力基础上，使用权力。不管怎样粉饰，发动一场政变的潜在成本是巨大的。埃及人以他们国家悠久的、起码名义上宪政史为傲。军管即便不是完全违宪，起码也是有违宪之嫌。毫无疑问，军事统帅部的担心是，违反意思相当不明确的埃及宪法，会使军方在政治上和法律上陷入困扰。<br><br>

    一场正式政变还可能危害到与美国的重要军事关系。自从穆巴拉克倒台后，美国总统奥巴马的政府对于直接军事统治一贯秉持明确的反对态度。据报道，美国官员曾对埃及将领提出警告，一旦发动军事政变，美国有可能停止对埃及的一切援助。<br><br>

在政治方面上，军队的强制力也不太奏效，尤其是对付像伊斯兰教徒那样的严密的组织。现在单是街道级别的穆斯林兄弟会组织就渗透或至少控制了包括内政部在内的一些国家部门。不像1954年时，纳赛尔和他的官员同僚们围捕穆斯林兄弟会分子时，几乎遇到没有任何阻力。但是，今天，军方将面对的截然不同的局势。对平民部署重型武器意味着跨越诸多红线，说实在的，是不可想象的。部署军队会造成诸多问题，平民对手遍布全国，。而且，鉴于穆斯林兄弟会过去与军队的对抗，他们很有可能进行反击。<br><br>

    至于军队的高人气，也可能是昙花一现。其中一个重要因素是军方高层在政治上保持中立，直接统治即便有可能，也会非常困难。更具挑战的是，在政治剧展开后，驾驭埃及这艘船，驶离经济悬崖。穆尔西的低支持率多半是由于经济危机造成的种种影响――如果军方夺权，所有这一切势必还会维持原状，任何问题都无法得到快速解决。<br><br>

    军队心知肚明，他们不能指望7月1日聚集在解放广场上，团团围住直升机欢呼的民众的忠诚度。世俗的反对派当中，对军方统治的厌恶情绪非常普遍，而且也正是这个因素在去年的总统大选第二轮中是很多人把票投给了穆尔西。当时，他的竞争对手是军方支持的艾哈迈德 沙菲克。虽然世俗反对派支持军队削弱兄弟会的势力，但一旦军方试图掌权，这种支持很快会烟消云散。<br><br>

    军方的内部政治使得“政变与否”的问题变得更加复杂。毕竟，赛西是由穆尔西任命的，他本人也是伊斯兰教主义者，他在就读美国陆军战争学院时的作品和言论都能佐证这一点。在他就任期间，禁止兄弟会成员加入埃及军事学院的禁令已经解除，而且，他有至少一名关系密切的家庭成员，他的侄子，就是一名穆斯林兄弟会成员。对于武装部队的司令而言，埃及伊斯兰事业崩塌，其耻辱是难以宽恕的。很显然，由此看来，他希望穆尔西及支持他的伊斯兰教徒能够一道进行有效治理。<br><br>

    尽管伊斯兰教在内享有军官团的拥护，但也有反对的声音。然而，比政治倾向更重要的是，官员对于体制的忠诚度，以及作为民族的最终捍卫者，他们的自身形象。假如赛西表现出要为伊斯兰教牺牲国家利益，那他也将面临失去其官员拥护的风险。为保住其地位，赛西能做的非常有限。<br><br>

    总之，赛西面临着严重的政治危机，如果他作出错误举动，抑或他不作出任何举动，那么这场危机都很可能沦为深层暴乱。如果他决定给穆斯林兄弟会更多时间与对手周旋，并有效地管理国家，那么他也不能指望埃及军队对他的忠诚度会有多大。如果他的行为被认定为反民主，如果加速国家秩序崩溃，那他也不能指望美国的支持他。看起来，赛西像把埃及握在掌心，但事实远非如此。可怜这位马上之人，不得不对充满挑战的前程深思熟虑。 <br><br>

解放军总政治部主任：坚决抵制“军队国家化”那一套 <br><br>

2011年06月20日   财新网 <br><br>

称国内外敌对势力用所谓“军队非党化、非政治化”和“军队国家化”那一套，来攻击我们党对军队绝对领导的根本原则和制度，其根本目的是妄图使我军脱离中国共产党的领导<br><br>

财新网（记者 汪苏）中央军委委员、总政治部主任李继耐日前在《求是》杂志撰文指出，要始终不渝地坚持党对军队的绝对领导。称对国内外敌对势力“军队非党化、非政治化”“军队国家化”那一套，要坚决抵制。<br><br>　　

　　文章指出，党对军队的绝对领导，是我军建军的根本原则和永远不变的军魂，是我国的基本军事制度和中国特色社会主义政治制度的重要组成部分，是党和国家的重要政治优势。　　<br><br>

　　李继耐表示，我国基本军事制度与西方军事制度的根本区别，在于我国的基本军事制度维护的是最广大人民的根本利益，西方资本主义国家军事制度本质上维护的是资产阶级利益。西方一些国家实行政党间接掌控军队，有其产生的阶级基础和历史条件，是与资本主义社会的阶级属性、政党制度、执政方式紧密相连的，我们决不能照抄照搬。　<br><br>

　　他称，国内外敌对势力用所谓“军队非党化、非政治化”和“军队国家化”那一套，来攻击我们党对军队绝对领导的根本原则和制度，其根本目的是妄图使我军脱离中国共产党的领导，进而推翻中国共产党的执政地位，颠覆中国特色社会主义制度。对这些错误政治观点，我们要坚决抵制，始终做到坚定不移地听党的话、跟党走。　　<br><br>

　　李继耐表示，新形势下，我军建设的内外环境发生深刻变化，官兵成分和价值观念趋于多样，战争形态和作战方式发生新的变化，军队组织形态现代化逐步推进，这些都对保持人民军队性质宗旨提出新的要求。始终不渝地坚持党对军队绝对领导，就能使我军始终保持坚定正确的政治方向，保持人民军队的性质、本色和作风，保持强大的凝聚力和战斗力，经受住各种复杂严峻考验，成为让党和人民永远放心的人民军队。　　<br><br>

　　李继耐称，坚持党对军队的绝对领导，必须更加注重从思想上政治上建设部队。他表示，要认真贯彻落实《军队党员领导干部廉洁从政若干规定》，大力加强干部队伍建设，确保枪杆子永远掌握在忠于党的可靠的人手中。要严格党的政治纪律和组织纪律，确保政令军令畅通，确保全军官兵坚决听从党中央、中央军委和胡主席指挥。<br><br>

谈坚持党对军队绝对领导的极端重要性<br><br>

2011年06月07日  解放军报<br><br>

近年来，境内外敌对势力把军队作为重要目标，加紧渗透破坏，极力攻击党对军队的绝对领导，大肆宣扬“军队非党化、非政治化”和“军队国家化”，企图动摇我们党执政的重要基石。在这场严肃的政治斗争面前，充分认清党对军队绝对领导的重要性和必要性，始终保持清醒政治头脑和坚定政治立场，显得尤为重要。<br><br>

　　党对军队的绝对领导是我们党艰辛探索得出的真理性认识<br><br>

　　中国共产党缔造自己的军队，并将其置于绝对领导之下，不是从哪个政治家头脑中简单构想出来的，而是在艰苦卓绝的武装斗争中，在与党内错误思想的斗争中，在推进马克思主义军事理论中国化的历史进程中，以鲜血为代价换来的真理性认识。<br><br>

　　党对军队绝对领导是我们党正确把握中国革命特点规律得出的科学认识。殖民地半殖民地的旧中国，长期处于帝国主义、封建势力和资产阶级反动派的蹂躏压迫之下，中国革命的敌人异常强大，反革命统治异常残酷，决定了被压迫阶级的政党必须建立自己的军队，开展独立的武装斗争才能完成革命的任务。在建党之初，由于对这个问题缺乏深刻认识，我们党在国民党反动派叛变革命时付出惨痛代价，党从血的教训中深刻认识到“枪杆子里面出政权”的真理。我们党在创建人民军队之始，就确立了“党的作用高于一切”、“支部建在连上”等原则制度，并在武装斗争实践中不断成熟完善，对独立掌握军队、开展武装斗争的认识也不断深化。正如毛泽东指出，中国共产党领导中国民主革命，无议会可利用，无合法斗争权利，只能开展武装斗争，只有依靠人民军队和人民战争。离开了我们党独立领导的武装斗争和人民军队，就没有无产阶级的地位，就没有人民的地位，就没有共产党的地位，就没有革命的胜利。<br><br>

　　党对军队绝对领导是我们党内无产阶级思想与各种非无产阶级思想激烈斗争得出的真理性结论。建军之初，由于红军长期处于分散的农村游击战争环境，红军的主要成分是农民和其他小资产阶级，还有一些来自旧军队的军官，不同程度地存在单纯军事观点和极端民主思想等观念，因而在建军原则上出现了“党对军队是指导还是领导、党要不要管理军队的一切”等争论。1929年2月召开的古田会议及其决议，及时纠正了当时党内存在的各种错误思想，确立了红军必须置于中国共产党的绝对领导之下的根本建军原则，对创建新型人民军队具有里程碑意义。长征途中我们党同张国焘与党争兵权、分裂红军进行了坚决斗争，抗战初期又及时纠正了王明“一切服从统一战线，经过统一战线”的右倾投降主义错误，坚持和发展了党对军队绝对领导的根本原则和制度。在我军80多年发展进程中，不论遇到什么样的政治风浪和严峻考验，不论国内外敌对势力怎样渗透破坏，党对军队绝对领导的原则和制度没有丝毫含糊和动摇，成为我军不乱不垮、纯洁巩固、无往不胜的重要法宝。<br><br>

　　党对军队绝对领导是我们党坚持马克思主义军事理论与中国实际相结合的成果。无产阶级必须掌握革命领导权和拥有革命军队，是马克思主义的基本原理。1871年，马克思在总结巴黎公社失败的教训时明确指出：“无产阶级专政的首要条件就是无产阶级的军队，工人阶级必须在战场上争取自身解放的权利”。中国共产党在缔造和领导人民军队的实践中，把马克思主义军事理论与中国革命实际相结合，确立了党对军队绝对领导的根本原则和制度，解决了新型人民军队如何创立、建设和发展的重大问题。这一根本原则和制度，实现了党的思想政治领导与军事行政领导的统一、集体领导与个人负责的统一、党的组织与军队建制的统一、党领导军队与国家领导军队的统一，丰富和发展了无产阶级军队建设理论，成为我军不断发展强大的成长胜利之魂。80多年来，我们党先后创立形成了毛泽东军事思想、邓小平新时期军队建设思想、江泽民国防和军队建设思想、胡锦涛关于新形势下国防和军队建设重要论述，贯穿其中的一条耀眼夺目的“红线”，就是“党对军队绝对领导是我军永远不变的军魂”。<br><br>

　　党对军队的绝对领导是我国的基本军事制度和中国特色社会主义政治制度的重要组成部分<br><br>

　　胡锦涛主席指出：“党对军队的绝对领导，是我军建军的根本原则和永远不变的军魂，是我国的基本军事制度和中国特色社会主义政治制度的重要组成部分，是党和国家的重要政治优势。”<br><br>

　　“军事制度”，是指国家或政治集团组织、管理、维护、储备和发展军事力量的制度。随着中国革命的胜利和党的执政地位的确立，我军成为国家的武装力量，我们党及时坚定而富有远见地将武装力量的领导和建设纳入国家制度体系，把党指挥枪的根本建军原则上升为国家意志，成为我国的基本军事制度和中国特色社会主义政治制度的重要组成部分。<br><br>

　　第一，党对军队绝对领导基本军事制度的根据在于党、国家、人民在根本利益上的一致性。我们党是全国各族人民利益的忠实代表，我国是人民当家做主的社会主义国家，我军是全心全意为人民服务的人民军队。在中国政治舞台上，我们党所代表的利益，与国家的利益、人民的利益，在根本上是高度统一、融为一体的。我军既是党的军队、人民的军队，也是社会主义国家的军队，党领导军队与国家领导军队是完全一致的。历史和实践充分证明，坚持党对军队绝对领导，是利党、利国、利民的好制度，符合人民的利益，也是社会主义国家的根本利益所在。<br><br>

　　第二，党对军队绝对领导基本军事制度得到了国家和军队法律法规的确认和保障。《中华人民共和国宪法》明确规定：中华人民共和国中央军事委员会领导全国武装力量，中央军事委员会实行主席负责制。中国共产党的中央委员会有权向全国人大推荐国家中央军事委员会的领导人，中央军事委员会其他组成人员的人选，由中央军事委员会主席提名。《中华人民共和国国防法》明确规定：中华人民共和国的武装力量受中国共产党领导，武装力量中的中国共产党依照中国共产党的章程进行活动。《宪法》是国家的根本大法，《国防法》是规范国家国防行为的基本法，具有最高权威性，为党对军队的绝对领导提供了最有力的法理基础和法律依据。同时，这一根本制度也贯穿到共同条令、政工条例、军队基层建设《纲要》以及党委、党支部工作条例等一系列军队法律法规中，成为军队一切行动的根本遵循。<br><br>

　　第三，党对军队绝对领导基本军事制度是我国政治制度体系的重要组成部分。新中国成立后，我们建立了工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政的社会主义国家，实行了与西方国家不同的政治制度，中国共产党成为中国特色社会主义事业的领导核心。政治体制决定军事体制，军事体制必须适应政治体制。在军队的领导和指挥上，只能由中国共产党来掌握，而不允许其他任何政治力量来领导。党对军队绝对领导的基本军事制度，与我国的人民代表大会制度、中国共产党领导的多党合作和政治协商制度、民族区域自治制度和基层群众自治制度一起，构成了中国特色社会主义政治制度的坚强支柱，确保了人民当家做主。正因如此，在我国现实政治生活中，中华人民共和国中央军事委员会与中国共产党中央军事委员会是一致的。这有利于运用国家政权的力量加强军队建设，有利于保证军队的最高领导权和指挥权的高度集中统一，有利于发挥军队在保卫和建设国家中的职能与作用，是最符合中国国情军情的科学有效制度。<br><br>

　　党对军队绝对领导是党巩固执政地位和实现国家长治久安的重要保证<br><br>

　　新中国成立60多年来，社会主义事业之所以蒸蒸日上，中国共产党执政之所以坚如磐石，很重要的一条就是坚持党对军队绝对领导。我军创建80多年来，之所以能够不断发展壮大，从胜利走向胜利，最根本的是党的正确领导。实践证明，坚持党对军队的绝对领导，事关党的事业兴衰成败，事关国家治乱安危，事关人民幸福安康。<br><br>

　　党对军队绝对领导是巩固党的执政地位的重要力量保证。中国共产党成为执政党，是历史的选择、人民的选择。但执政党的执政地位不是与生俱来的，也不是一劳永逸的。早在新中国成立前夕，毛泽东同志告诫全党“巩固这个胜利，需要很久的时间和要花费很大的气力”。巩固党的执政地位，要靠纲领路线正确，靠人民群众支持，靠执政能力提高，也要靠军队提供重要力量保证。正如胡主席指出的：“只要我们党紧紧依靠全国人民，牢牢掌握人民军队，国家就出不了什么大乱子，我们就可以‘任凭风浪起，稳坐钓鱼船’”。20年前，苏共取消党对军队的领导，结果在关键时刻军队临阵倒戈，导致共产党下台，苏联解体。最近西亚北非一些国家政权更迭，军队保持“中立”或反叛是一个重要因素。这些教训值得我们汲取。当前，我们党面临的长期的复杂的严峻的执政考验、改革开放考验、市场经济考验、外部环境考验，我军必须始终听党的话、跟党走，成为党巩固执政地位的中坚力量，社会主义红色江山才能永不变色。<br><br>

　　党对军队绝对领导是确保国家长治久安的坚强安全保障。一个国家的军队掌握在什么人手中，始终是关系这个国家前途命运的重大问题。近代中国，军阀混战、有国无防、任人宰割，就是因为军队沦落成为个人或狭隘利益集团服务的工具。只有中国共产党领导的人民军队，才能真正为国家和人民的利益赴汤蹈火、浴血奋战，成为捍卫国家的坚强柱石、保卫人民的钢铁长城、建设国家的重要力量。邓小平同志曾深刻指出：“我们国家所以稳定，军队没有脱离党的领导的轨道，这很重要。”新世纪新阶段，我国要紧紧抓住重要战略机遇期，继续推进社会主义现代化事业，实现中华民族伟大复兴，迫切需要一个和谐稳定的内部环境和安全稳定的外部环境。当前，我国正处在发展的关键期、改革攻坚期和矛盾凸显期，长期面对西方敌对势力西化分化的渗透破坏，面对发达国家在经济、科技、军事方面占优势的压力，只要坚持党对军队绝对领导不动摇，就能保证我军有效履行职能使命，坚决维护国家安全和发展利益，确保国家安宁、社会和谐、人民幸福。<br><br>

　　党对军队的绝对领导是保持我军性质宗旨和强大战斗力的不竭动力。从思想政治上建军治军，是我党我军的基本原则和特有优势。80多年来，正是因为我们党用先进的思想、崇高的理想和铁的纪律灌注部队，我军才始终保持了统一的意志、坚强的团结，既没有被敌人从外部所撼倒，也没有从内部被分裂；始终保持了强大战斗力，从小到大、由弱到强，无坚不摧、无往不胜；始终赢得了人民群众爱戴和支持，有了不竭的力量源泉。新形势下，意识形态领域斗争尖锐复杂，敌对势力对我军的渗透破坏一刻也没有停止，应对多种安全威胁、完成多样化军事任务更加繁重。要充分认清党的绝对领导是我军的“命根子”，充分认清“军队非党化、非政治化”和“军队国家化”要害是割裂军队与政治、政党的关系，实质是妄图使我军脱离党的领导，目的是动摇党的执政地位。毫不动摇地坚持党对军队绝对领导，就能以党的先进性确保人民军队的先进性，始终保持坚定正确的政治方向；就能依靠党卓越的政治智慧和高超的战略战术，保持我军英勇善战的本色和强大战斗力；就能以党与时俱进的品格，保持我军的生机活力，不断推动国防和军队建设科学发展。 柯大文<br><br>


解放军报：必须认清“军队国家化”言论背后的阴谋<br><br>

2012年05月15日   解放军报 <br><br>

5月15日解放军报发表评论文章《领导干部要做讲政治顾大局守纪律的表率》，文中指出，“一直以来，‘军队非党化、非政治化’‘军队国家化’的鼓噪声不绝于耳，必须深刻认清这些错误言论背后的阴谋，深刻理解党对军队绝对领导的历史渊源和地位作用，切实在这个重大原则立场上不犹豫、不含糊、不动摇。必须带头遵守和执行根本制度，自觉把自己置于党组织的领导之下，确保枪杆子永远听党指挥。”
<br><br>
军队各级领导干部是部队的带兵人，无疑也应当成为讲政治、顾大局、守纪律的“排头兵”。领导干部只有自觉响应胡主席提出的讲政治、顾大局、守纪律的要求，积极参加学习教育活动，不断强化政权意识、责任意识和忧患意识，高标准、严要求、做模范，才能带领官兵把我军真正建设成为军魂意识牢固、履行使命坚强的军队。<br><br>

在政治上多一分清醒，切实做信念坚定绝对忠诚的排头兵。当前，改革开放进入攻坚阶段，需要解决的矛盾问题交织叠加。国际敌对势力对我实施西化分化的战略图谋一刻也没有松懈。在复杂多变的思潮和现象面前，领导干部必须多一份清醒，做党的事业最坚定的拥护者、最忠诚的实践者。坚持以真学真信培养忠诚。我们党是建立在科学理论基础上的政治组织。马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想、中国特色社会主义理论体系，在认识和改造实践的历史进程中，越来越显示出真理的光芒。只有真学深学党的指导思想和创新理论，才能掌握真理的力量、明确前进的方向、担当肩负的使命。个别党员干部出现信仰意识淡化、党性观念模糊和原则立场摇摆等问题，根子都在理论根底浅薄上。因此，必须把学习作为讲政治的第一任务，紧紧扭住坚定信念这个根本，始终突出铸牢军魂这个关键，深入学习中国特色社会主义理论体系，学习胡主席关于新形势下国防和军队建设重要论述。始终坚持发扬联系实际优良学风，切实在树立马克思主义世界观上下工夫，形成分析判断事物的正确方法和立场，带头传承我军高举旗帜、听党指挥的红色基因。用实际行动体现忠诚。高度的集中统一，是我们党在长期革命斗争中形成的宝贵经验，也是领导建设和改革的组织优势。作为党的领导干部，应当自觉执行命令体现忠诚，强化号令意识、执行意识，确保军令畅通，坚决听从党中央、中央军委和胡主席指挥。以步调一致体现忠诚。严格按照政治纪律要求规范言行举止，从小事做起，从自身严起。以顾全大局显示忠诚。用积极的姿态处理好对上负责和对下负责、部门利益与整体利益、眼前需要与长远需要的关系，坚决服从组织需要，一切听从组织安排，正确对待个人进退留转，始终对党和人民忠心耿耿。靠根本制度维护忠诚。党对军队绝对领导的一系列根本原则和制度，是体现我军性质宗旨、确保忠诚履行使命的政治法宝。一直以来，“军队非党化、非政治化”“军队国家化”的鼓噪声不绝于耳，必须深刻认清这些错误言论背后的阴谋，深刻理解党对军队绝对领导的历史渊源和地位作用，切实在这个重大原则立场上不犹豫、不含糊、不动摇。必须带头遵守和执行根本制度，自觉把自己置于党组织的领导之下，确保枪杆子永远听党指挥。<br><br>

在使命上多一分担当，切实做忠于职守干事创业的排头兵。每一个领导岗位，都是党安排的为国防和军队建设服务的舞台，党员干部应时刻想着组织的信任和赋予的责任，以干事为责，以干事为荣，以干事为乐，把自己的人生追求和价值目标融入我军革命化、现代化、正规化建设进程之中。自觉担当起推进事业的责任。始终保持艰苦奋斗的劲头和锐意进取的激情，以使命任务为牵引，改进工作指导，不断开创部队建设的新局面。我军实现由机械化向信息化转变是党中央、中央军委部署的战略任务，党员干部应全力聚焦这个中心，以深化军事斗争准备为牵引，切实加快信息化建设和改造进程，走开军民融合发展路子，努力做到有所作为、有所成就，创造出无愧于组织、无愧于岗位的业绩。人才是最重要的战斗力。领导干部必须担当起识才育才的政治责任，确保军队建设人才兴旺、后继有人。应以大视野识才，坚持德才兼备、以德为先的人才标准，主动深入官兵发现人才，不让千里马卧槽、不让老实人吃亏。以大手笔育才，坚持把人才培养列入经常性议事日程，适应部队对人才、官兵对成才“两个需要”，自觉树立大“人才观”，舍得在人才培养上投入资源，舍得把优秀干部送出去培养锻炼。以大胸怀用才，坚持发扬民主、任人唯贤、五湖四海，加大优秀年轻干部选拔使用力度，以自觉行动端正用人导向。在当前，顾大局的一个重要方面是保稳定。维护社会稳定大局和保持部队自身安全稳定是硬任务。领导干部要担当起安全发展、稳定发展的责任，注重从贯彻科学发展观、落实以人为本要求的高度，更加重视贯彻依法治军方针，更加重视重大安全问题防范，更加重视提高安全能力，把硬任务抓实。今年面临许多政治大事，安全稳定工作的形势特殊、背景特殊、要求特殊，必须坚持以建设的思路抓安全，以安全日、安全月、安全季的方式抓经常，以形成本能抓养成，以“问题归零”的标准抓末端，努力形成“教育无死角、管理无盲区，安全无隐患”的良好态势。<br><br>

在作风上多一分正气，切实做光明磊落心系基层的排头兵。领导干部的一举一动，代表着党的作风和形象。杨业功一辈子艰苦奋斗、杨善洲一辈子服务百姓、刘金国一辈子刚正不阿，他们以模范的行动，为党赢得了民心。作为党员领导干部，就应该带头弘扬我党我军的优良传统，用好的人品官德和清风正气团结凝聚广大官兵。树立公道正派之气。公平正义、克己奉公是锤炼领导作风的根本着力点。应坚持立党为公，牢固树立正确的权力观，作决策、搞建设要出以公心，服从服务于整体大局，不搞劳民伤财、为个人捞取政治资本的形象工程、政绩工程。坚持公正处事，对部属一视同仁，不搞亲疏远近，充分发扬民主，扩大政务公开，公平、公正处理涉及官兵切身利益问题，不人为制造不公平，不因不公平而造成民怨。坚持正派做人，对组织忠诚，对同志仁厚，对自己严律，襟怀坦白，言行一致，不迎合迎来送往、逢迎讨好、相互吹捧的庸俗习气。培养敬兵爱兵之情。官兵看一个领导干部，一个重要标准就看其心系基层、服务官兵的热情和力度。应不断强化服务意识，恪守为兵之责，多办利兵之事，把党对广大官兵的关心关怀落到实处。特别是要注意端正对基层官兵的根本态度，多讲兵话、多谈兵事，尊重官兵的主体地位，一事当前先想到基层、先想到士兵。注重关心关爱官兵的全面发展，努力满足其精神文化需求、成长进步需求，帮助他们强思想、增素质、有作为。注重弘扬勤俭节约之风。思想松懈、贪图享乐是当前一些不正之风的思想根源。领导干部应带头培育艰苦奋斗的思想作风、资源节约的工作作风、勤俭朴素的生活作风，当好红管家、打好钱算盘。充分认识到，领导干部的思想作风、工作作风和生活作风是讲政治、顾大局、守纪律的具体体现。讲政治、顾大局、守纪律学习教育成果大不大，一个重要方面就看党员干部的作风好不好；党员干部也只有不断弘扬好作风、改掉坏作风、创立新作风，讲政治、顾大局、守纪律学习教育活动才被证明见诸成效、结出硕果。<br><br>

在纪律上多一分敬畏，切实做依法行政严格自律的排头兵。敬畏法度、依法办事，既是对党负责，也是对自己负责。近年来，部队发生一些违法违纪案件，教训沉痛、警示深刻。领导干部应自觉在法规纪律范围内行使职权，克服权大胆大、官升气长的不良风气，努力做思想纯洁、作风纯洁、廉洁自律的模范。自觉养成依法用权的习惯。不论是参与党委决策还是决定行政事务，都应有法规意识和程序观念，按照规划搞建设、按照程序用干部、按照标准抓保障、按照预算管经费，加强决策行为的法规审查和可行性认证，避免好心办坏事、热情搞浪费。坚持大胆开拓和谨慎用权相统一，职务越高、权力越大，越要常怀敬畏之心、戒惧之意，确保权力行使的科学性、合法性。自觉强化服从监督的意识。经常性的、有效的监督是帮助领导干部改进工作、避免犯错的有力武器。应自觉落实党的监督制度，敢于坚持原则、修正错误，严肃地而不是敷衍地开展批评和自我批评，推动党内生活保持团结向上的风气。始终保持自省自警的胸怀，善于和勤于从部属的意见建议中查找问题，从领导和同事的交流中反思不足，积极改进思想方法和工作方法。大力支持纪委和审计等职能部门开展监督，指导各业务系统加强行业监管，形成权力监管的合力。要坚守清廉纯洁的底线。经常对照廉洁从政行为准则审视自己、约束配偶子女和身边工作人员，自觉摒弃“从众”“侥幸”“麻痹”心理，防止出格越线。始终保持廉政没有特殊、风险没有例外的警觉性，坚持从小节、小事、“小意思”严起，培养健康高尚的精神追求和生活情趣，纯洁内外交往关系，真正把时间、心思和精力都投入我军现代化建设事业上。<br><br>



党对军队绝对领导的基本依据 <br><br>
 
2011年07月19日  人民日报  <br><br>
　党对军队的绝对领导作为马克思主义建军学说的重要内容和中国特色社会主义政治制度的重要组成部分，具有充分的理论依据、实践依据和法律依据。增强坚持党对军队绝对领导的自觉性和坚定性，需要从理论上科学认识和准确把握这些依据。<br><br>

　　理论依据。马克思主义关于阶级、政党、国家、军队及其相互关系的理论，是坚持党对军队绝对领导的根本理论依据。马克思主义认为，军队作为执行政治任务的武装集团，是一定社会阶级斗争的产物，是一定阶级及其政党的工具。无产阶级只有掌握军队，才能推翻资产阶级统治，取得无产阶级革命胜利。马克思在总结巴黎公社的经验教训时指出，无产阶级专政的首要条件就是建立无产阶级的军队。因此，无产阶级政党领导军队是无产阶级革命事业取得胜利的基本前提，也是保持军队无产阶级性质的重要条件。中国共产党人在长期的革命和建设实践中丰富和发展了马克思主义关于无产阶级政党与军队关系的理论，把党与军队的关系提高到绝对领导的高度，把坚持党对军队的绝对领导作为人民军队建设的根本原则。毛泽东同志指出，从马克思主义关于国家学说的观点来看，军队是国家政权的主要成分。谁想夺取国家政权并想保持它，谁就应有强大的军队。邓小平同志指出，军队要始终不渝地坚持党的军队、人民的军队、社会主义国家的军队的性质。江泽民同志指出，坚持党对军队的绝对领导这一根本政治原则，是我们军队的军魂，任何时候都不能动摇。胡锦涛同志强调，党对军队的绝对领导是我军建军的根本原则和永远不变的军魂，是我国的基本军事制度和中国特色社会主义政治制度的重要组成部分，是党和国家的重要政治优势。始终不渝地坚持党对军队的绝对领导，关系人民军队的性质和宗旨，关系党执政地位的巩固和执政能力的提高，关系国家长治久安。

　　实践依据。首先，党对军队的绝对领导是我们党从旧中国军阀混战中总结出的历史经验。在我国近代历史上，存在过长期的军阀割据和混战局面。当时，政党和政府不仅失去了对军队的领导权，而且成为大小军阀随意操纵的政治玩偶。军阀之间大小战祸连年不断，使整个国家陷入巨大灾难中。因此，建立一套防止个人掌握兵权、政党真正领导军队的制度，是反封建的重要任务。实行党对军队的绝对领导，是近代以来中国社会历史发展的必然要求。其次，党对军队的绝对领导是我们党在中国革命具体实践中形成的根本原则。中国革命的主要特点是武装的革命反对武装的反革命，主要组织形式是军队，主要斗争形式是战争。这就决定了党对军队实行绝对领导的极端重要性。党在创建初期对此认识不足，以蒋介石为首的国民党掌握和控制了军队，结果大量共产党员和革命群众牺牲在国民党的屠刀下，革命成果几乎丧失殆尽。惨痛的教训使我们党深切认识到“枪杆子里面出政权”、党对军队的领导权就是党和人民的生存权和发展权的深刻道理。最后，党对军队的绝对领导是我们党从人民军队发展壮大中确立的坚定信念。中国革命战争的特点是以弱胜强、星火燎原。创造这个军事奇迹需要强大的政治优势。我们党以无产阶级世界观教育军队，使官兵牢固树立崇高的理想信念，具有英勇无畏的献身精神和敢打必胜的战斗作风；党实行军队内部民主，建立和谐融洽的内外关系，形成官兵一致、军民一致的整体力量；党在军队中设立的各级组织，成为部队统一领导和团结战斗的坚强核心；党用先进的军事理论、正确的作战原则和灵活机动的战略战术指导战争，使我军在同强大敌人的斗争中始终立于不败之地。实践证明，党的绝对领导是我军发展壮大须臾不可离开的法宝。<br><br>

　　法律依据。我国宪法规定，中华人民共和国的武装力量属于人民，中华人民共和国中央军事委员会领导全国武装力量。这实际上是以法的形式把军队纳入国家组织体制，使我军在国家政权中的地位得到法律上的确认，便于运用国家政权的力量加强国防和军队现代化建设，更好地履行对外反侵略、对内防颠覆的双重职能。根据宪法精神，1997年全国人大制定通过的军事基本法――国防法明确规定，中华人民共和国的武装力量受中国共产党领导。这一法律原则既坚持了党对军队绝对领导的优良传统，又体现了四项基本原则这个立国之本的政治要求，体现了中国共产党作为唯一执政党在国家政治生活中的领导地位。中国共产党创建90年、执政62年的历史和现实充分证明，中国共产党是中国工人阶级的先锋队，同时是中国人民和中华民族的先锋队，党的性质和宗旨决定了党始终为人民利益而奋斗。党的人民性与社会主义国家的人民性的根本一致性，是党对军队绝对领导的根本法理依据。在我国，党对军队的领导与国家对军队的领导是一致的，强调党对军队的绝对领导，是因为党领导军队更具基础性、根本性，是中国特色军事领导制度的实质所在。<br><br>

党对军队的绝对领导是我军从胜利走向胜利的根本保证<br><br>
 
 
宋清渭 2007年08月01日 <br><br>


作为一名参加革命60多年的老战士，我亲身经历了自抗日战争以来军队建设发展的风风雨雨，亲眼见证了军队建设的一些重大事件和重要历史时刻。抚今追昔，越发深切感受到南昌起义以来的80年，是我军在中国共产党领导下不断发展壮大的80年，是为实现党的纲领、任务而顽强奋斗的80年。80年的光辉历程告诉我们，坚持党对军队的绝对领导，是人民军队不断发展、永远立于不败之地的根本保证，是我军永远不变的军魂。<br><br>

　　一、我军的历史就是在党绝对领导下发展壮大的历史<br><br>

　　我军从诞生之日起，就始终以党的旗帜为旗帜，以党的意志为意志，以党的方向为方向，一刻也没有离开过党的指挥。南昌起义时，党就成立了以周恩来同志为书记的中共前敌委员会，作为党领导起义部队的最高机构，在各军、师建立党委，设立党代表，各团建立总支或支部，团、营、连三级设立政治指导员，并明确规定了在起义军中“党的作用高于一切”的原则，指出党的组织是一切组织的根基，这是中国共产党独立领导军队、建设军队的伟大开端。1927年9月29日，毛泽东同志在著名的“三湾改编”中，主张在部队中建立党的各级组织，创造性地提出 “支部建在连上”，并且在连以上各级设党代表。“三湾改编”初步确立了党对军队绝对领导的制度，对于我党领导和建设军队，推动革命事业的发展，产生了深远影响。毛泽东同志在红四军党的第九次代表大会上，还明确规定我军是一个执行政治任务的武装集团，强调我军必须置于党的绝对领导之下的原则。后来，又针对长征中张国焘分裂党、分裂红军，另立中央的严重错误，谆谆告诫全党：“我们的原则是党指挥枪，而决不允许枪指挥党”。抗日战争时期，毛泽东同志亲自修改的西北局高干会议的报告，对军队党的建设和政治工作又作了系统总结，并指出了以后建设的方向。解放战争时期，毛泽东同志根据战争迅猛发展的新形势，重新强调了加强军队中党的思想建设和集体领导制度，在理论和实践上对如何加强党对军队绝对领导问题，规定了明确的原则。建国后，毛泽东同志又根据新的历史条件的变化，多次强调必须加强军队党的思想建设和党对军队的领导工作，要求中央和地方的党委要抓军事，从而保证了党在政治上、思想上、组织上牢牢掌握部队。<br><br>

　　我15岁参加八路军，16岁加入中国共产党，一直从事军队党的政治工作。在长期的工作实践中，深切体会到党的三代领导核心和胡锦涛同志对军队党的建设的极端重视，也深深感受到了党对军队绝对领导所产生的巨大威力。59年前，我作为华东野战军山东兵团所属部队的一名年轻基层指挥员，参加了著名的济南战役，亲身经历了那场血与火的洗礼。当时，天上有敌人的飞机轰炸，地上有敌人的大炮轰击，国民党军队还疯狂地使用毒气弹、火焰喷射器，我军阵地前沿变成了一片火海，攻城勇士们冒着枪林弹雨，架起云梯，奋勇冲上城头，前面的倒下了，后面的又冲上去，子弹打光了，就用刺刀、铁锹、砖头与敌人搏斗，尸体填满了护城河，鲜血染红了河水，部队八天八夜连续作战，越打越有后劲，使敌人毫无喘息之机，胜利解放了济南城。这种在党领导下产生的英勇顽强、不怕牺牲、前赴后继、奋勇攻坚的革命英雄主义精神，已成为我们战胜一切敌人、克服一切困难的强大力量，激励着千千万万爱国将士克服艰难困苦，战胜了比我们强大无数倍的敌人，用小米加步枪，赶走了日本帝国主义，打败了国民党几百万用美式装备武装起来的军队，推翻了蒋家王朝，建立了新中国。<br><br>

　　在社会主义建设时期，我军广大官兵始终坚持和发扬听党指挥的优良传统，在急难险重任务中不怕牺牲，勇往直前，在进退去留面前顾全大局，甘于奉献，用鲜血和生命保卫国家和人民的财产，用奉献和牺牲诠释着军人的崇高价值。进入新世纪新阶段，时代变了，环境变了，条件变了，但坚持党对军队绝对领导的光荣传统没有变。人民解放军在党的领导下，不仅出色地完成了保卫祖国安全，保卫社会主义建设的历史任务，而且在粉碎林彪、“四人帮”分裂党和军队阴谋的斗争中经受住了考验，成为深受人民群众信赖的人民民主专政的坚强柱石。<br><br>

　　二、牢牢把握党对军队绝对领导的基本要求<br><br>

　　党对军队的绝对领导，主要是政治领导、思想领导和组织领导，具有全面性、直接性和权威性的特点，其内涵和外延是十分丰富和广阔的，涉及到部队建设的各个方面，不同时期有不同的具体要求。但无论时代怎么发展，形势怎么变化，有三个根本性问题必须始终牢牢抓住不放。<br><br>

　　坚持党对军队绝对领导，最核心的是一切行动听从党中央、中央军委指挥。这是党对军队绝对领导的最高政治要求，是坚持党对军队绝对领导的核心所在。党旗所指，军旗所向。党的领导是我们取得革命事业胜利的“三大法宝”之一。这些年军队建设和发展取得的巨大成就，也充分证明了这一点。今天，我们强调坚持党对军队的绝对领导，就是必须坚决做到一切行动听从党中央、中央军委和胡主席指挥。党的十六大以来，以胡锦涛同志为总书记的中央领导集体，在国际形势复杂多变和国内改革发展稳定任务艰巨繁重的形势下，继往开来、与时俱进、勤奋努力，卓有成效地开展工作，进一步开创了中国特色社会主义事业的新局面，赢得了人民的高度信赖和衷心拥护。作为新时期的革命军人，必须认真学习、坚决贯彻党中央、中央军委和胡主席的一系列决策指示，在任何时候、任何情况下，都坚定不移地听党话、跟党走，始终按照党指引的方向前进。<br><br>

　　坚持党对军队绝对领导，最根本的是坚持党对军队绝对领导的一系列组织制度。我军在长期的革命斗争实践中，形成了一系列党对军队绝对领导的制度。这些制度是马克思主义与中国革命和我军具体实际相结合的产物，是我军性质和宗旨的体现，是党对军队实施领导的内容、方式和原则的规范，对保证枪杆子绝对掌握在党的手里，发挥了极其重要的作用。这些制度主要包括：军队的最高领导权和指挥权集中于党中央、中央军委；坚持党委统一的集体领导下的首长分工负责制；团以上单位设立政治委员和政治机关；坚持民主集中制原则；支部建在连上；除了中国共产党及其助手中国共产主义青年团以外，任何其他党派、团体和宗教势力均不得在军队中建立组织和进行活动，等等。我军的高度稳定和集中统一，离不开这些制度，党对军队绝对领导的贯彻和实现，也离不开这些制度。经过80年的风风雨雨，这些基本制度已经在我军官兵中深深扎根，成为我军安身立命、发展壮大的根基，成为指引军队建设和发展的根本方向和动力源泉。历史告诉我们两个基本事实：无论形势怎样复杂险恶，我军从来没有一支成建制的部队被敌人拉过去；无论野心家、阴谋家多么狡猾阴险，从来没有一个人能够利用军队实现其阴谋。这是党对军队绝对领导原则和制度的胜利。这些根本原则和制度，必须始终不渝地贯彻落实。<br><br>

　　坚持党对军队绝对领导，最现实的是旗帜鲜明地反对“军队非党化、非政治化”和“军队国家化”的错误思潮。这些年，国内外敌对势力大肆鼓吹“军队非党化、非政治化”和“军队国家化”。受此影响，我们有少数同志在军队的政治属性和指挥权的归属上存有一些疑虑，对党对军队绝对领导的科学性、必要性认识不足。在体制编制调整改革中，个别人片面认为设立政治委员、政治机关、政治干部是造成我军编制大、官兵比例失调的主要原因，这种错误思想是十分有害、十分危险的。“军队非党化”、“军队非政治化”和“军队国家化”，实质就是要我军摆脱党的领导，改变我军性质，从而搞垮我们的党和我们的社会主义国家。这是西方敌对势力“西化”、“分化”战略的一个重要组成部分。我们军队领导干部对此应该保持高度警惕。<br><br>

　　三、领导干部应带头做党对军队绝对领导的忠诚实践者
<br><br>
　　领导干部地位重要、责任重大，在坚持党对军队绝对领导上有着很强的示范和导向作用。战火纷飞的年代，我军之所以能战难关、胜强敌，根本的一条就是我们的党员领导干部，对共产主义的信仰异常坚定，对党的事业无限忠诚，对党的指挥绝对服从。新世纪新阶段，仍然需要领导干部发扬我党我军这种优良传统和作风，带头捍卫、忠诚践行党对军队绝对领导的一系列根本原则和制度。<br><br>

　　坚持不懈地用马克思主义特别是党的创新理论武装思想、指导行动，始终是确保人民军队听党指挥的重要保证。政治上的坚定来源于理论上的清醒。我们这些从战争年代走过来的老同志都不会忘记，当时无论形势多么紧张、环境多么艰苦，只要有一点时间，大家都会坐下来学文化、学理论，学得如饥似渴。正是在刻苦的学习和慢慢的积累中，我们渐渐树立了为共产主义奋斗终身的崇高理想。实践充分证明，对革命理论学习领会得越透彻，就越能深刻认识党的先进性，增强对党的忠诚和信赖；就越能从立党为公、执政为民这个本质上，深刻认识党的军队、人民的军队和社会主义国家的军队的内在统一性，增强听党指挥的坚定性；就越能自觉运用科学的世界观和方法论观察分析问题，在大是大非面前保持清醒的政治头脑。对于今天的领导来讲，带头抓好党的理论武装，仍然是一项十分重要的政治任务。<br><br>

　　坚定对党的政治信念，是确保军队听党指挥的基础和保证。我军老一辈革命家，都是爱党信党的楷模。他们有的为了寻找党、追随党，历尽艰险不退缩，受尽委屈不抱怨，牺牲奉献不后悔。与战争年代和建国初期的困难艰苦相比，今天的情况发生了翻天覆地的变化。但坚定的政治信念仍然是一个至关重要的问题。特别是随着时间的推移和干部队伍年轻化步伐的加快，我们部队中经历过战争生死洗礼和复杂政治斗争考验的同志越来越少，一大批充满生机与活力的年轻同志充实进来。应该说，这些同志多数对党是忠诚的、信念是坚定的。但也有极少数人不信马列信迷信，有的对反动笑话、灰色言论不斗争不反对，有的贪图享受、腐化堕落等等，最终沦为党和人民的罪人。作为党员领导干部，必须坚定对马克思主义的信仰，对中国特色社会主义的信念，对改革开放和社会主义现代化建设的信心，对以胡锦涛同志为总书记的党中央的信赖，以言行一致、模范带头的实际行动，把群众的力量聚集起来，很好地实现党的主张。<br><br>

　　着眼于政治建军，加强思想政治领导，牢牢掌握思想政治工作的主动权，是党对军队绝对领导的重要内容、重要原则和显著特点。思想政治上的领导从根本上决定着军队的政治性质和政治方向。回顾我们党在各个时期的历史经验，结合自己长期从事政治工作的切身经历，感受最深的一点是，主动权如同生命线，丧失主动权就会偏离生命线。新世纪新阶段，部队党的建设面临的任务十分繁重，但最重要的是增强主动意识，提高思想政治领导能力，解决好从政治上掌握部队的问题。作为部队的领导干部，应切实增强政治敏锐性，充分认清新形势下思想政治领域斗争的复杂性、长期性，认清从思想上政治上掌握部队的艰巨性、紧迫性，高度关注隐蔽战线斗争，扎实做好防奸保密工作；进一步加强对新情况新问题的研究，不断增强思想政治教育的针对性、主动性和实效性，切实把广大官兵凝聚在党的旗帜下。
<br><br>
　　坚持党对军队的绝对领导，选什么样的人至关重要。当前一些党委在选人用人时，片面强调干部的文凭、年龄和经历，轻视政治上的要求。这样下去是很危险的。一个人本事再大，政治上靠不住也不能用。如果把对党不忠诚的干部用起来，能力越强危害越重，年龄越轻危害时间越长，职务越高危害越大。坚持党对军队绝对领导，必须把政治上忠诚可靠的人选进各级班子，确保枪杆子永远掌握在忠于党的人手中。尤其是在当前世界还不太平、各种敌对势力侵蚀影响和腐蚀拉拢加剧的复杂形势下，应该比以往任何时候都重视把好政治关，既要重才更要重德，切实把那些忠于党、忠于人民、忠于国家和军队的优秀人才选拔到各级领导岗位上来，切实打牢党对军队绝对领导的组织基础。<br><br>

2013年05月13日 文汇报<br><br>

巴基斯坦大选12日初步结果显示，穆斯林联盟(谢派)脱颖而出已成定局。这意味着曾经在1999年执政期间遭遇军事政变的该党领导人纳瓦兹・谢里夫将第三次执掌巴基斯坦总理大权。<br><br>

<a href= "pic05.html">没有伊斯兰的世界</a><br><br>
　　谢里夫胜局初定<br><br>


　　据巴电视新闻报道，截至12日下午，穆盟(谢派)已稳获94个国民议会席位，并有望获得130席，只要再争取一些独立人士或小党派的支持，该党最终获得272个竞选席位的过半多数已无悬念。<br><br>

　　12日早些时候，本次选举的有力竞争者、前板球明星伊姆兰・汗领导的正义运动党已经承认选举失败。正义运动党领导人阿萨德・奥马尔祝贺穆盟(谢派)成为巴基斯坦第一大党，但他同时对本党的表现“感到满意”。根据初步投票结果，原来在巴国民议会中没有一席地位的正义运动党成为巴第二大党派，并赢得巴四大选区之一的开伯尔-普赫图赫瓦省地方议会选举。<br><br> 

　　对于过去五年执政的人民党来说，这次选举无疑是一个重大挫折。初步统计显示，人民党已由巴第一大党降为第三大党。人民党的现总理阿什拉夫、前总理吉拉尼以及多位部长都在本选区选举中失利。相比2008年大选，人民党在关键大省旁遮普的选情一落千丈，其势力仅限于南方的信德省。<br><br>

　　事实上，此次大选结果并不完全出乎外界预料。选前，许多国际观察人士和巴基斯坦问题专家都不看好人民党的选情，但在政坛老将谢里夫和政治新秀伊姆兰・汗之间难以断言。<br><br>

　　巴基斯坦高级记者努萨特・贾维德称，谢里夫的胜选说明两点：一是巴基斯坦人民更愿意选择稳健地保持现状而不是充满不确定性的革命，二是所有通向中央权力的道路都须经过旁遮普。印度媒体则将谢里夫的胜利归结于其雄厚的政治根基、经济实力和主打经济牌的竞选策略，其狠抓经济的竞选承诺尤其迎合选民的心理。不管怎样，谢里夫时隔14年重回巴基斯坦的权力巅峰，将成为该国历史上3次当选总理的第一人。<br><br>

　　印巴和解出现转机<br><br>

　　谢里夫重新上台究竟对巴基斯坦意味着什么尚待观察。乐观者认为，这次大选将是巴历史上首次由一个完整任期的民选政府向另一民选政府的和平过渡，而曾经主导国家多年的巴军方对此次大选采取了中立和支持的态度。这似乎为巴社会的民主发展提供了新的契机。不过，也有分析指出，谢里夫再次执政未必能给巴基斯坦带来多少变化。过去20年来，巴基斯坦政权在人民党和穆盟(谢派)之间轮换，谢里夫“王者归来”并没有改变巴政坛传统的家族政治格局。目前看来，穆盟(谢派)难以单独执政，需要与其他小党派组成联合政府。在人民党实力犹存、正义运动党异军突起的背景下，谢里夫如何弥合巴多年来激烈的党派斗争和社会矛盾仍面临不少挑战。<br><br>

　　此外，如何处理民选政府与军方势力错综复杂的微妙关系，以及能否有效打击恐怖主义、实现发展社会经济的目标，都将影响谢里夫执政的前景。印度《经济时报》12日的一篇评论认为，“也许谢里夫执政初期政府会显得更有效率，例如腐败和极端恐怖活动有所减少，但一切很快将恢复原样。”<br><br>

　　在对外关系上，谢里夫提出重新考虑巴方对美国反恐战事的支持，让不少美国媒体担心美巴关系将出现波折。而在印度媒体看来，谢里夫是一个相对熟悉的政治对手，其首席外交顾问主张发展对印关系，这似乎对印巴和解进程是一个积极信号。<br><br>

　　据报道，印度总理辛格已经向谢里夫胜选表示祝贺并邀请其在双方适当的时候访问印度。(驻新德里记者 牛震)<br><br>

巴基斯坦穆斯林联盟（谢里夫派）的前身是全印穆斯林联盟，这个联盟在1906年建立。1920年真纳当选为该联盟主席。1940年3月在拉合尔联盟代表大会上，真纳提出印度穆斯林应建立一个分治的伊斯兰国家的主张。<br><br>

1947年在英国的影响下，印巴分治，巴基斯坦建国后，联盟分裂，其中巴基斯坦穆斯林联盟取得了执政权。1962年由阿尤布・汗主持联盟工作。此后，该联盟再度分裂为大会派穆斯林联盟和理事会派穆斯林联盟。大会派穆斯林联盟于1969年又分出加尧姆派穆斯林联盟。大会派穆斯林联盟主席是前总统阿尤布・汗，主要领导成员是中央政府各部部长。1964年提出建国“十四点纲领”，内容包括执行1962年宪法，维护国家统一，发展重工业，鼓励私营企业，反对帝国主义和殖民主义，加强同伊斯兰国家的联系等。1969年3月法兹鲁尔，卡德尔，乔德里接任联盟主席。<br><br>

1970年在议会选举中联盟只得两个席位，独立以来首次成为在野党。1971年该联盟参加国会反对党联盟即统一联盟党，反对佐勒菲卡尔・阿里・布托领导的巴基斯坦人民党。1973年3月参加统一民主阵线。理事会派穆斯林联盟于1962年10月成立，得到了真纳妹妹法蒂玛・真纳的支持，成员多为著名政治活动家和学者，第一任主席是巴基斯坦前总督、总理卡沃杰・拉希姆，他在1971年11月参加国会反对党联盟统一联盟党，批评巴基斯坦人民党的左翼政策。<br><br>

加尧姆派穆斯林联盟又称真纳穆斯林联盟、全巴穆斯林联盟，于1969年3月成立。1970年8月通过联盟章程，主张加强中央集权，消灭贫困，实行合理的农业税收，基本工业归国有。在1970年大选中，在国会赢得10个席位。支持叶海亚・汗对东巴采取的行动，支持布托政府，与人民党积极合作，曾组成西北边境省联合政府。1985年，前总理居内久重新组建穆斯林联盟，并任主席。主张建立伊斯兰民主政治体制。后巴基斯坦穆斯林联盟又分裂成两大派，分别是巴基斯坦穆斯林联盟（领袖派）和巴基斯坦穆斯林联盟（谢里夫派），但谢里夫派仍是巴基斯坦穆斯林联盟的主体，属于较温和的一翼。<br><br>
1990年的议会选举中，穆盟（谢里夫派）取得微弱优势，纳瓦兹・谢里夫首次出任总理。<br><br>

1993年的议会选举中，穆盟（谢里夫派）成为巴第二大党、最大反对党。<br><br>

1997年2月的议会选举，该党赢得了国民议会三分之二多数议席，组建政府，纳瓦兹・谢里夫第二次出任总理。<br><br>

1999年10月12日，时任陆军参谋长的佩尔韦兹・穆沙拉夫发动军事政变推翻谢里夫政府，谢里夫被捕并被判刑，其弟及夫人库尔苏姆代理党务。<br><br>

2000年11月，以舒贾特・侯赛因为首的部分穆盟领导人反对加入国家民主联盟同人民党合作，与库尔苏姆等领导人产生分歧，他们另行组成穆盟（哈基基派）。同年12月10日，谢里夫流亡沙特阿拉伯。<br><br>

2007年11月，谢里夫返回巴基斯坦后，继续任该党领导人、反对派领袖。<br><br>

2008年的议会选举中，穆盟（谢里夫派）成为巴第二大党，取得90席，最大反对党。<br><br>

2013年的议会选举中，穆盟（谢里夫派）成为巴第一大党，取得125席，赢得压倒性胜利，再度执政组建政府，谢里夫第三次出任总理。<br><br>

巴基斯坦的政治数学 <br><br>
 

  叶海林  2011-01-04 
 2011年1月3日晨，巴基斯坦人民党执政联盟中的第二大党，在国民议会中拥有25个议席的统一民族运动党（MQM）宣布和人民党分道扬镳。MQM不但退出了联合政府――这意味着该党在政府中的所有联邦部长、部长和国务部长(倒是一共也没几个)都辞职走人，该党还宣布在国会正式加入反对党阵营――这意味着该党的25名国民议会议员从此将在所有议题上投人民党的反对票。<br><br>

　　就后一项决定而言，MQM的态度比此前不久同样宣布和人民党分手的执政联盟成员、巴基斯坦穆斯林学者协会法兹尔派（JUI-Fazl）还要坚决，后者只是退出了联合政府，目前在国会中仍然投政府的赞成票。这也就是为什么拥有6个席位的JUI-Fazl退出政府所引发的震动比MQM的类似动作要来得轻微的原因――议席的多少当然是另外一个原因。<br><br>

　　MQM转投反对党目前还仅仅是法律概念上的，这个长期控制卡拉奇地方政权的“穆哈吉尔”政党并没有正式和最大的反对党前总理纳瓦兹・谢里夫领导的穆斯林联盟（谢里夫派）建立联盟关系。他们只是开始了公开“接触”而已，而这种“接触”对于人民党吉拉尼政权来说，很可能是致命的。<br><br>

　　人民党在国民议会中拥有130个议席，而谢派穆盟只拥有90个，理论上即使加上MQM的25个，也仍然低于人民党。但问题在于人民党需要172个议席才能继续执政，对于吉拉尼来说，谢派穆盟增加多少议席并不是最重要的问题，人民党到哪里才能找到足够议席以弥补MQM出走所造成的损失才是。<br><br>

　　MQM显然也认识到了这一点，因此这个和人民党长期处于城乡对立状态的“小党”未雨绸缪地与其他几个“小党”订立了攻守同盟。MQM在出走时不但和谢派穆盟进行了接触，并且与前总统穆沙拉夫将军一手打造出的穆斯林联盟（领袖派）以及JUI-Fazl约定，三方保持协调行动，不单独和其他政党建立合作关系。这一决定使得三党获得了超过其实际议席数的影响力。<br><br>

　　三党合作构成了巴基斯坦国民议会中第三大阵营，三党一共拥有86个议席，只比谢派穆盟少4个。这一数字足以保证人民党如果不和谢派穆盟建立合作就无法获得继续执政的最小多数，同样的，也保证了谢派穆盟如果不和三党合作就只能选择重新与扎尔达里-吉拉尼阵营握手。<br><br>

　　这难道不意味着三党在把自己逼入死胡同吗？倘若谢里夫和扎尔达里-吉拉尼捐弃前嫌，组建一个拥有多达200多个议席的大联合政府，从而将三党彻底边缘化。然而这种理论上的可能性恰恰是三小党合作的基础。因为三个小党的领袖――MQM的阿塔夫・侯赛因、穆盟（领袖派）的乔杜里・侯赛因以及JUI-Fazl的皮尔・帕格拉都很清楚，政坛耆宿纳瓦兹・谢里夫绝对不会在这个时候伸手拉自己的拉合尔老乡吉拉尼一把。两人之间曾经有过的一箭之仇――吉拉尼许多年前在地方选举中击败过谢里夫――倒在其次，真正的决定性原因在于谢里夫自从流亡的沙特阿拉伯返回以来处心积虑精心谋划的就是这样一种局面。<br><br>

　　谢里夫在过去三年里从人民党的兄弟变成人民党的敌人，虽然自己麾下的议席只增加了一点点，人民党的执政基础却在不断被削弱。谢里夫曾经鼓动律师和记者发动“长征”，帮助大法官乔杜里复职成功，剥夺了人民党的司法权；也曾公开批评人民党的宗教和反恐政策，通过讨好宗教政党挖了人民党的墙脚；现在人民党执政联盟在国会的多数地位中已经风雨飘摇，谢里夫干吗还要出面当人民党的救星？在巴基斯坦，只有得了健忘症的人才会不记得当年正是谢里夫两次打倒了人民党政权。或许当下在谢里夫看来，正是卷土重来的绝佳时机。<br><br>

　　这件事情，吉拉尼知道，谢里夫知道，三小党的领袖当然也知道，所以他们才会采取这一看起来凶险实际上无比安全的联盟策略，倒逼谢里夫寻求和三党的合作。除非谢里夫自寻烦恼去想办法延长人民党政权的寿命，否则三小党可以确定无疑在未来的新联合政府中获得比今天更大的收益。而这就是这三个小党对当下巴基斯坦政局的数字密码的破译结果。<br><br>

　　就巴基斯坦政坛反复求解的政治数学谜题而言，英国人在印度次大陆留下的政治遗产至少有一点是积极的――它提高了一部分人的算术水平。<br><br>

	<b><a name="T11">茉莉花革命</a> </b><br>
	<hr>
	
2010年年底至2011年年初，非洲国家突尼斯发生了要求总统本-阿里下台的持续抗议活动，并演变为持续骚乱。总统本・阿里被迫选择离开突尼斯，前往沙特避难。总理加努希出任临时总统。在阿拉伯国家，这是第一次一个政权因民众抗议而倒台。茉莉花是突尼斯国花，这次政权更迭也被称为“茉莉花革命”。
<br><br>
1、2010年12月17日，突尼斯南部地区西迪布吉德一名26岁的街头小贩遭到城市警察的粗暴对待，该青年大学研究生毕业，但因经济不景气无法找到工作，在家庭经济负担的重压下，无奈做起小贩。在遭到粗暴对待后，该青年自焚抗议，因伤势太重，不治身亡。这名青年的过世，在激起突尼斯人同情心的同时，也激起了突尼斯人长期以来潜藏的对失业率高涨、物价上涨以及政府腐败的怒火。<br><br>
2、事后当地居民与突尼斯国民卫队发生冲突，冲突进而蔓延到全国多处，形成全国范围内的大规模社会骚乱，并造成多人伤亡。最终，在小贩自焚后的第29天，总统本・阿里不得不放弃这个自己统治了23年的国家，在2011年1月14日深夜飞往沙特。<br><br>
3、当日总理加努希宣布根据宪法接管总统职权并举行了就职宣誓，但戏剧性的是，2011年1月15日，突尼斯宪法委员会认为加努希总理继任共和国总统违反宪法，应由众议长福阿德・迈巴扎从15日起代行总统职权，并最迟在60天之内举行大选。<br><br>
4、尽管过渡政府已经形成，但现首都突尼斯市仍然充满着恐慌和不确定性，当地的人们开始囤积食物和其他日常生活用品，恐慌无处不在。突尼斯的局势不是很明朗，关键要看现今这个临时政府能不能稳定状态。据介绍，现有军队在街上维持秩序，街上行人非常少，市场等公共场所都已经关门，现权力仍然在旧的社会和政治体制掌权人手中，但是突尼斯人并不希望他们的革命止于本・阿里的流亡以及其23年独裁统治的崩溃。<br><br>

本・阿里  本・阿里<br><br>
本・阿里于1987年发动不流血政变推翻前总统哈比卜・布尔吉巴上台，此后他在1994年、1999年、2004年和2009年四次连任突尼斯总统。从1987年起的大约20年间，国内生产总值每年平均以接近5%的速度增长。然而2008年的金融海啸导致旅游业走下坡，失业率上升。在2010年的调查报告指出，突尼斯的经济增长率为3.8%，但失业率达14%，其中又有30%是年轻人，另有报道指青年失业率可能高达52%。<br><br>
此外，通货膨胀、政治腐败、言论缺乏自由及生活条件不佳也是造成此事件的主要原因之一。<br><br>
除了上述的民生问题之外，还有一些原因来自于互联网。之前维基解密揭露2009年6月的美国外交电文，内容为引述当时美国驻突尼斯大使Robert Godec的报告，指出本・阿里家族及其兄弟手足与掌管该国经济的一名黑道份子勾结，并指第一夫人勒伊拉泽鲁・本・阿里靠兴建贵族学校赚取利益。揭露外交电文后加深了民众对于政府不满的情绪，而这起揭露事件也成为骚乱爆发的重要导火线之一。<br><br>
1、政府腐化和经济危机是主因，1987年本・阿里和美国总统奥巴马一样，以“改变”为口号开始执政，此后，他四次连选连任突尼斯总统，执政至今。<br><br>
2、本・阿里已经执政了23年，突尼斯这些年来政治体制僵化，2002年示威者对穆罕默德・蒙阿西表示敬意  示威者对穆罕默德・蒙阿西表示敬意<br><br>
推动了所谓的宪法修正案，在他长期个人执政下，突尼斯的个人自由和新闻封锁也比较严重。在突尼斯，名义上允许反对党存在，但是实际上是本・阿里长期执政。他任人唯亲的现象比较严重，其女婿在国内的口碑就非常不好。人民生活还很艰难的时候，经常大搞宴会，腐败严重。<br><br>
3、该事件也反映了经济危机对突尼斯的冲击。突尼斯经济主要依靠鲜花、日用品和磷酸盐的出口，以及旅游业和侨汇。金融危机爆发后，对这几项的打击非常大，失业率很高，尤其是大学生等高学历人群的失业情况严重。根据突尼斯政府公布的数据，2009年突尼斯失业率达到14%。<br><br>
4、本・阿里本人也很重视教育，培养了很多人，但是没有这种就业的市场，反而造成了潜在的问题。<br><br>
5、还有一个更重要的问题，政府处理不当，发生事件以后，突尼斯政府先捂，再瞒，并且采用硬的方法镇压。相关组织也发表讲话认为本・阿里政府使用武力过度。不但没有解决矛盾，还激化了矛盾。<br><br>

阿拉伯世界忧虑茉莉花革命蔓延<br><br>
 2011年01月19日  第一财经日报<br><br>

 两天内，已经有3名埃及人企图自焚。当地时间18日，两名埃及男子企图在埃及首都开罗闹市区自焚，而在前一日，刚刚有一名埃及年轻人在人民议会前自焚。<br><br>

　　同时，17日，在西非国家毛里塔尼亚，一名男子在该国总统府官邸前自焚，以抗议政府虐待其部族。<br><br>

　　这接连而来的自焚事件被外界认为是受到了突尼斯“茉莉花革命”的鼓励。<br><br>

　　北非也存在危险<br><br>

　　截至17日，因大学生小贩自焚而引起的突尼斯“茉莉花革命”看似暂告一段落，突尼斯总理加努希当日宣布，突尼斯民族团结政府正式成立。加努希称，新政府将集中精力进行突尼斯人民期盼已久的政治、经济、社会全面改革。但目前，突尼斯人仍未走出对国家未来未知的恐慌，囤积粮食和日用品的现象仍然存在。<br><br>

　　同样恐慌的还有阿拉伯世界的其他国家。在整个中东地区，其他阿拉伯国家的领导人都紧密地关注着突尼斯局势，担心“茉莉花革命”是否会成为整个地区变革的号角。<br><br>

　　“北非发生和突尼斯一样的情况的危险也是存在的。”中国社科院非洲研究室主任贺文萍向《第一财经日报》分析，“他们的政治结构和社会问题都有相似性，失业问题也有相似性。”<br><br>

　　由于物价不断上涨，近一个月来，阿尔及利亚人也在游行，截至目前已经导致3人死亡，约400人受伤。数据显示，2011年开年以来，该国部分食品价格上涨了30%。16日，阿尔及利亚人也开始采用自焚的方式示威抗议，先后有四宗。<br><br>

　　“阿尔及利亚也发生过街头暴力，死了人；约旦也有类似的情况。”贺文萍说，因为最近国际商品价格上涨，经济危机导致了这些国家内部的困难。<br><br>

　　埃及作为阿拉伯世界大国，突尼斯前总统本・阿里逃亡沙特后，示威人群就开始聚集在突尼斯大使馆门前高呼“穆巴拉克，下一个”以及“本・阿里，告诉穆巴拉克飞机也在等着他”等口号。<br><br>

　　西方推波助澜<br><br>

　　欧美媒体也大多数一边倒地发表文章称，“‘茉莉花革命’敲响了中东的警钟”。《华盛顿邮报》刊文称，“茉莉花革命”首先会向埃及、阿尔及利亚、利比亚和约旦扩散，因为这些国家面临与突尼斯同样的经济困境，该文还特意提醒埃及总统穆巴拉克应汲取本・阿里的教训，进行经济和政治改革。<br><br>

　　尽管埃及贸易和工业部部长拉希德已经对外界排除了“突尼斯变局”会在埃及再现，但很多政治观察家和社会活动积极分子都表示并不同意。贺文萍认为，突尼斯变局对阿拉伯国家来说也是一个教训，这些国家当权者应该采取正确的应对措施，可能不会形成多米诺骨牌效应，但同时也可能会成为改革的契机。<br><br>

　　专注中东媒体研究的中东问题专家马克・林奇则认为，尽管目前在其他阿拉伯国家还没有发生群体性暴力事件，但一切皆有可能，尤其是在社会公共媒体力量参与的情况下。<br><br>

　　“它（传播起来）太快、太简单了。”林奇认为，从技术角度看，应该将之称为“推特革命（Twitter revolution）”。他认为，尽管在中东地区，主流阿拉伯电视台仍然可能会是最主要的媒体平台，他们可以对自焚大学生小贩的新闻进行选择性播放，但是新旧媒体的结合已经成为改变该地区一股强大的力量。<br><br>

　　贺文萍称：“北非、阿拉伯国家有一种历史惯性，长期执政的强力人物统治媒体、军队等。有研究社会问题的人认为阿拉伯社会的容忍度比较高，不敢于表达个人意识。”“不过，重要的是，这种结合已经破坏了政府控制信息的能力，整个阿拉伯世界的人都能从互联网上看到突尼斯暴乱的画面场景，政府越来越难介入控制。”林奇说。<br><br>

　　美国方面，奥巴马发表讲话赞扬突尼斯人的“勇气”和他们“勇敢”的斗争。此前，美国经常被阿拉伯世界领导人指责宣扬和渗透美式民主，在阿拉伯世界支持强力人物的同时又呼吁该地区人民争取更多的自由权利。<br><br>

　　“奥巴马和法国都是这样表态的，周围的阿拉伯国家也这么说，要尊重突尼斯人民的选择，这是一种现实主义的做法，大家很明白前任政府大势已去。”贺文萍认为，如果从深层次来说，和美式民主的思想渗透有一定关系，增强了当地人的自主意识。<br><br>

	<b><a name="T12">埃及军方宣布罢免总统穆尔西</a> </b><br>
	<hr>
	

2013年07月04日<br><br>

（联合早报网讯）埃及国防部长塞西3日晚发表全国电视讲话，宣布提前举行总统选举、由最高宪法法院院长暂行总统职权。<br><br>

塞西说，军方提出的埃及未来发展路线图主要包括四方面内容：暂停使用现行宪法；提前举行总统选举，最高宪法法院院长将在总统选举前暂行总统职权；成立联合政府；成立专门委员会商讨修改宪法。<br><br>

塞西说，军方与总统穆尔西此前的谈判宣告失败，穆尔西2日的演讲没能满足人民的要求。塞西强调，军方不会对埃及人民的要求坐视不管，但将永远不涉足政治。塞西在讲话最后呼吁所有埃及人放弃暴力，通过和平方式表达诉求。<br><br>

据BBC报道，在开罗解放广场上反对穆尔西的人们听到广播后爆发出欢呼，成千上万的反穆尔西示威者释放焰火，开始庆祝。<br><br>

但军方首脑上电视发表讲话后不久，开罗城北即爆发支持和反对穆尔西示威者的冲突，造成4人死亡。<br><br>

军方逮捕穆兄会成员<br><br>

穆尔西领导的穆斯林兄弟会的电视台在播放完军方首脑讲话实况转播后，即停止播放节目。埃及国家通讯社说，穆斯林兄弟会的电视台的经理们已经被捕。<br><br>

据法新社报道，埃及机场官员3日证实，埃及军方已经禁止总统穆尔西及其所属的埃及穆兄会数名高层出国。<br><br>

据报道，埃及军方3日下发禁令，禁止总统穆尔西及其他数名人员出国。机场人员证实，他们已经接到军方命令，防止穆尔西、穆兄会最高领袖穆罕默德 巴迪及其副手离境。<br><br>

另据报道，埃及总统穆尔西安全顾问当天批评称，埃及目前正经历军事政变。<br><br>

穆尔西已转移到秘密处所<br><br>

穆尔西3日深夜通过半岛电视台发表讲话，称自己仍是埃及的合法总统。<br><br>

穆尔西在讲话中重申自己是合法总统，强调合法性以及宪法和法律都不可替代。他说：“我已经准备好与任何方面展开对话。”他表示“不接受新的‘合法性’”。<br><br>

有埃及当地媒体报道，穆尔西目前已经转移到秘密处所。<br><br>

穆尔西发表电视讲话前，曾在其社交网站官方账户上表示，国防部长塞西当天的讲话以及提出的未来发展路线图是“彻底的军事政变”。穆尔西称，所有自由的人民都拒绝军方路线图，他呼吁所有埃及人遵从宪法和法律，不要响应军方的“政变”。穆尔西说，“‘政变’将把埃及带入黑暗”。<br><br>

背景<br><br>

埃及军方1日为支持穆尔西和反对穆尔西的阵营解决当前危机设置48小时期限，称如果期限过后这场危机仍未解决，军方将采取行动介入，公布路线图方案以及监督路线图实施的措施。<br><br>

穆尔西2日发表全国电视讲话说，宪法赋予他的合法性不可替代，他愿用生命捍卫总统的合法地位。3日下午，穆尔西通过社交网站发表声明，呼吁通过建立联合政府达成全国和解，强调将按照自己的路线图回应民众诉求，但未像反对派期待的那样同意下台，并提前举行总统选举。<br><br>

	<b><a name="T13">西方民主能拯救中东国家吗</a> </b><br>
	<hr>
当前，中东政治转型如火如荼，政局走向成为各方关注焦点。8月4日，叙利亚总统巴沙尔宣布，该国将实现多党制，打破40多年来阿拉伯复兴社会党一党专政的局面。与此同时，埃及在穆巴拉克倒台后，执政多年的“民族民主党”也被打入冷宫，国内一下冒出上百个形形色色的新政党。此外，突尼斯等国开放党禁，海湾君主国也推出种种政改措施。一时间一向被认为是“独裁政体生态保护区”的西亚北非，出现了向“民主政治”转向的新气象。很多人将中东出现多党制视为好兆头，认为其正经历浴火重生、凤凰涅的过程。但历史发展从来不是线性过程，这种政治转型对中东国家的利弊得失之影响，远比想象的复杂。<br><br>

　　邓小平同志曾说过，评价一个政治体制是否正确，关键看三条：第一是政局是否稳定;第二是是否能增进人民的团结，改善人民的生活;第三是看生产力是否得到持续发展。换言之，实践是检验政治转型成败的唯一标准，而不能简单看是否实行了多党政治。<br><br>
更多资讯，请访问：<a href= "http://www.retter2012.com" title="点击进入"> retter2012.com </a>。<br><br>

　　中东一旦实行多党制，可能打开潘多拉魔盒<br><br>

　　从一般意义上说，实行民主政治需要满足若干前提条件。一是相对丰裕的物质基础。竞选政治首先是要拼资源、拼财富，没有足够的财富和资源支撑，根本无法负担民主政治带来的“交易成本”。统计表明，人均收入在500美元以下的国家几乎不可能成为民主国家，而人均收入在500―2000美元，其民主进程仍不稳定。只有当人均收入达到3000―4000美元，才最有可能实现稳定、民主的发展。<br><br>

　　二是庞大的中产阶级。只有当社会形成以中产为主的橄榄形社会，才可能使政治竞争始终在不背离基本共识的范围内进行。而在贫富悬殊、社会两极分化情况下，民主政治要么演变成“富豪政治”，要么演变成“民粹政治”。<br><br>

　　第三，实行民主政治还需要完成国族整合过程使多数民众的国族和公民意识，盖过对本部族、教派的认同，否则民主竞争必然会沿着种族、教派界限展开，出现“政治教派化”趋势。而在中东诸国中，能够同时满足这些条件的国家基本没有。<br><br>

　　美国中东问题学者托马斯・奥尼尔曾说过，“所有政治都是地方性的”。中东政治转型也要受内部社会政治环境的限制。无视这种地方性特色，一味将民主政治视为普世价值引入，往往淮橘成枳，给当地带来的不是福祉，而是难以言说的苦涩。<br><br>

　　伊拉克就是典型案例。该国民众主要由逊尼派、什叶派和库尔德人三大部分构成。萨达姆时期，阿拉伯复兴社会党一党独大，国家政局高度稳定，并成为举足轻重地区强国。而实行多党议会制后，教派矛盾抬头，中央政府重大问题议而不决，更遑论在地区发挥主导型作用。<br><br>

　　叙利亚国内教派问题一点不比伊拉克简单。该国85%居民信奉伊斯兰教(其中逊尼派占80%，什叶派占20%)，11%信奉基督教，少数人信犹太教。该国过去政局动荡，频繁发生政变。直到l971年老阿萨德上台后，依托阿拉伯复兴社会党一党专政，才使叙利亚政局得以长期稳定。不难想象，叙利亚一旦实行多党制，无异于打开潘多拉魔盒，叙利亚很可能由中东政局最稳定国家，演变为中东动荡的新源头。 <br><br>
伊拉克的例证值得当前忙于政治转型的其他阿拉伯国家深思<br><br>

　　事实上，对包括中东在内的众多第三世界国家来说，由于几乎同时面临工业化、政治现代化、国族整合等很多难题，因此解决问题必须有主次先后。在尚未真正解决民生问题情况下，致力于经济发展，并强调集体纪律和辛勤工作、限制个人权利的做法，很容易得到民众的理解和支持。相比之下，由于民主发展往往与个人自由连在一起，因而推崇民主及由此带来的个人自由度的增加，实际也就意味着对政治稳定的威胁和对经济发展大计的偏离。因此政治发展往往被排在经济发展乃至国家安全之后，由此不难理解，为何许多第三世界盛行威权政治。<br><br>

　　而建立有组织纪律性的强大政党，正是当权者实行有效统治，建立强大政府的组织前提。例如，在阿拉伯复兴社会党统治或曾统治过的叙利亚和伊拉克，复兴党扮演的角色远远超过人们的想象。事实证明，像伊拉克和叙利亚这样有强大政党根基的国家，在中东诸国中综合实力往往较强，并具备纵横捭阖、角逐地区霸主的能力。<br><br>

　　伊拉克和叙利亚的这些特征，正是西方霸权国真正感到害怕的。有学者指出，伊拉克之所以让美国感到极大威胁，并非自由主义者强调的独裁专制、个人崇拜，镇压反对派之类，而是该政权与伊朗国王及沙特王朝，甚至与埃及政权不同。伊拉克政权的这一特征，使得一心想在中东称王称霸的美国，将伊拉克作为重点打压对象，目的就是要消除伊拉克政治体制的有效性，即打断伊拉克谋求复兴的脊梁骨。从国内形势看，伊拉克目前沧海横流，亟需铁腕统治和中央集权恢复秩序，但多党政治却使中央政府在重大问题上议而不决，至今不能保护自身安全，而不得不同意美军延长驻留时间。这样的民主转型无疑是“最坏的民主”。美国等于给伊拉克“剔了骨”，使伊拉克由中东强国成为半瘫痪国家。殷鉴不远，伊拉克的例证值得当前忙于政治转型的其他阿拉伯国家深思。<br><br>

　　政体改革属于次要问题<br><br>

　　从深层看，衡量政治制度优劣，关键不在政体，而是该政权依靠哪个阶级、主要为哪个阶级服务。正像一把刀是否锋利不是问题，问题关键是刀握在谁手里一样。中东现行模式弊端丛生，实际是掌权者阶级属性出了大问题，因此政治变革关键，应是进行阶级革命。相比之下，政体改革属于次要问题。“强人政治”之所以在阿拉伯世界盛行，当权者也青睐中央集权制，部分原因就是因为这种政体可以有效发挥功能，解决中东面临的种种棘手问题。一厢情愿地认为只要由集权走向分权(也就是将刀子变钝)，国家面临的沉疴将不治而愈，这种做法不过是舍本逐末，缘木求鱼，它只会使这些国家由一个误区，走向另一个误区。<br><br>

中东动荡说明了什么? <br><br>

2013年07月04日  新华每日电讯<br><br>

叙利亚烽火未熄，埃及最近的动荡又吸引了全球的目光。自穆尔西去年6月底当选埃及总统以来，埃及就没有消停过，最近几天更是到了伊斯兰势力与世俗自由派之间雌雄对决的关键时刻。埃及社会从未向今天这般迷茫、分裂和矛盾，古老的中东大国，前路漫漫，不知所终。<br><br>

　　把视野再放大一点，中东整体局势也实难乐观。前不久，一向被认为是中东伊斯兰国家民主楷模的土耳其，爆发了多年罕见的大规模反政府示威游行，这股波及全国67个城市的抗议浪潮虽然暂告平息，但抗议的根源仍未消除。而在多灾多难的伊拉克，恐怖爆炸已成家常便饭，无日没有人员伤亡。外媒分析，伊拉克如此发展下去，距离内战爆发的日子将不远矣。<br><br>

　　中东动荡原因复杂，其中有民族矛盾、部落冲突、教派争斗、领土纠纷，也有普通民众对集权统治不满引发的抗议和骚乱。尤其是近几年发生的“阿拉伯之春”，主要是民众对本国独裁统治不满而举行街头革命，加上西方势力的军事干涉，或导致统治者下台，或造成长期内战。但为什么随后而来的民主体制却未给这些国家打来和平、安宁与繁荣呢?<br><br>

　　从伊拉克、突尼斯、也门、利比亚到埃及，在把过去的集权统治者拉下马后，急切地拥抱民主制度，或在西方的安排下进行公开选举，本以为这条路能通往和解、宽容和自由，但结果却事与愿违。像伊拉克和埃及等国，强人离开犹如打开潘多拉的魔盒。可以预料，巴沙尔总统即便下台，叙利亚的枪声也不会很快停歇，教派之间和利益集团之间的冲突将是常态。<br><br>

　　这并非说中东国家就不适合民主，但文化积淀和宗教影响所形成的历史背景和复杂现实，注定使得阿拉伯世界在通往民主的转型之路布满荆棘。（江亚平）<br><br>

美国拒绝谴责埃及军方 称在政变问题上不选边站<br><br>
2013年07月04日  中国新闻网 <br><br>

据英国路透社7月3日消息，美国拒绝谴责埃及军方，在被问及埃及军方驱赶穆尔西下台是否合法时，美国国务院发言人珍 普萨基回答：“美国不会选边站。”路透社评论称，美国对埃及政变采取的缄默态度，引发其暗中支持政变的猜想。<br><br> 

报道称，埃及军方宣布最高宪法法院院长将暂行总统职权，埃及将提前举行总统选举，现行宪法暂时中止实施。对此，美方并未及时给出回应。而对穆尔西总统的罢黜立即获得了穆斯林及基督教徒的支持，美国或因此支持其路线图方案。 <br><br>

据报道，穆尔西2日发表全国电视讲话说，宪法赋予自己的合法性不可替代，他“愿用生命捍卫总统的合法地位”。埃及国防部长塞西则认为，其演讲没能满足人民的要求。(记者 刘瑾) <br><br>

	<b><a name="T14">阿拉伯之春</a> </b><br>
	<hr>
	
被西方媒体称为“阿拉伯之春”的运动是指自2010年年底在北非和西亚的阿拉伯国家和其它地区的一些国家发生的一系列以“民主”和“经济”等为主题的反政府暴力运动。这项暴力运动先后波及突尼斯、埃及、利比亚、也门、叙利亚等国，多名领导人先后下台，其影响之深、范围之广、爆发之突然、来势之迅猛吸引了全世界的高度关注。<br><br>

“阿拉伯之春”（The Arab Spring），又称“阿拉伯的觉醒”、“阿拉伯起义”，是指自2010年年底在北非和西亚的阿拉伯国家和其它地区的一些国家发生的一系列以“民主”和“经济”等为主题的反政府暴力运动，这些运动多采取公开示威游行和网络串连的方式，其影响之深、范围之广、爆发之突然、来势之迅猛吸引了全世界的高度关注，从2011年初开始至今尚未完全结束。究其本质，不过是阿拉伯的混战。 <br><br>
这场运动以北非国家突尼斯的本・阿里政权被民众抗议推翻为肇始，形成一场规模空前的民众反政府浪潮，如潮水般席卷整个阿拉伯世界，稳坐江山数十年之久的政治强人和独裁者如多米诺骨牌般接二连三地倒下。革命运动浪潮随后波及埃及、利比亚、也门、叙利亚等国，阿尔及利亚、约旦、沙特、阿曼、巴林、摩洛哥、科威特、黎巴嫩、卡塔尔等其他阿拉伯国家乃至部分非阿拉伯国家也都受到不同程度的影响，发生了一些抗议示威活动，但大都因政府的让步或示威规模不大而逐渐平息。<br><br>
截至2012年12月，此阿拉伯革命已经推翻了4个国家政权。2011年1月14日晚，突尼斯前总统本・阿里流亡沙特；18天后的埃及示威浪潮导致穆巴拉克在2011年2月11日宣布正式下台，权力移交军方；利比亚领袖卡扎菲的统治在2011年8月23日被推翻，2011年10月20日，卡扎菲被俘身亡；2012年2月27日，也门政治协议正式生效，总统萨利赫退位。<br><br>

导致这些动荡的主要原因包括：国家的专制统治、政治体制僵化、人权的侵犯、阿拉伯世界悬殊的贫富差距、政府贪污腐败、国民经济衰退、失业率居高不下、人民生活贫困；领导人长期执政，不思改革，政治经济分配不透明等等。<br><br>
全球金融危机加剧了阿拉伯世界的经济困难，推动了革命运动的爆发。另外，人口结构中大量受过一定教育、熟谙网络且对现状不满的年轻人成为了这次运动中的主要角色。<br><br>
值得一提的是，在这次运动中，现代移动通讯技术和互联网社交媒体起到了重要的作用。<br><br>

发生在突尼斯的自焚事件是整个“阿拉伯之春”运动的导火索。2010年12月17日，26岁年轻人穆罕默德・布瓦吉吉因经济不景气而无法找到工作，在家庭经济负担的重压下，无奈做起小贩，期间遭受城管的粗暴对待，抗议自焚，不治身亡。<br><br>

2011年3月6日，在周边国家都被革命浪潮波及的时候，叙利亚安全部队在德拉市逮捕了15名儿童，这些儿童因在墙壁上书写反对政府的言辞而被捕，受到残酷虐待。消息不胫而走，3月15日，大马士革、阿勒颇、哈塞克、德拉市以及哈马等城市的街头爆发了大规模反政府示威活动，报道称有数千人被捕；4月18日，约10万示威者在霍姆斯广场静坐，要求巴沙尔下台。<br><br>

2012年5月25日，叙利亚中部霍姆斯省的胡拉镇发生了震惊世界、惨绝人寰的屠杀案，其中包括49名儿童，现场惨烈。反对派指责这是政府军所为，政府军则予以否认。<br><br>

俄罗斯和变化中的世界：“阿拉伯之春”的教训与结论（作者俄罗斯总理、总统候选人 普京）<br><br>

<br><br>
我一直认为，所有国家的安全都密不可分、不允许过于经常地诉诸武力、无条件地遵守基本的国际法准则。对上述内容的轻视将导致国际关系的动荡。<br><br>

欺世盗名<br><br>

接二连三爆发的武装冲突，都是以人道主义目的作幌子，正在毁坏数世纪以来一直受到尊崇的国家主权原则。在国际关系中，道德和法律的真空正在日益形成。<br><br>

经常有人这样说，人权高于国家主权。的确，这是毫无疑问的，反人类罪应当受到国际法庭的惩罚。然而，当这一原则的运用可能损害国家主权，当人权是由外来势力维护，是有选择性的，即在“维权”过程中普罗大众的一些最基本、最神圣的权利，如生存权会遭到蹂躏，那这就不是什么崇高事业，而是最简单不过的巧言惑众了。<br><br>

重要的是，联合国及其安理会可以有效地对抗来自某些国家的蛮横要求，以及在国际舞台上的肆意妄为。谁都无权赋予自身联合国的特权，尤其是在针对主权国家使用武力的情况下。北约首当其冲，它试图将与 “防御联盟”不相称的职能揽上身，而且演得过于入戏。我们都记得，那些沦为“人道主义”行动和“民主火箭炸弹”输出牺牲品的国家，曾疾呼遵守国际法以及起码的人类道义，但无人理睬。没有人听到，也无人想听。<br><br>

歇斯底里
<br><br>
一年前，世人目睹了如下现象，即在众多阿拉伯国家似乎如有约定，同时爆发了推翻专制统治的游行示威。“阿拉伯之春”最初被人寄予催生积极变革的厚望，然而人们很快便发现，在许多国家，事态的发展并未按文明方式进行，没有确立民主，也未保护少数族群的权利，而是排挤对手、发动政变，统治方被更具侵略性的新统治力量所取代。<br><br>

来自外部的干预，对内部冲突其中一方的支持，令事态发展笼罩上负面色彩，该干预的性质就是武力干预。事态最终发展到一系列国家以人道主义口号为理由，借助空军，消灭了利比亚政权。作为尾声，还上演了对卡扎菲的非中世纪式，而是原始蛮荒式的镇压。
<br><br>
不能让某些人企图在叙利亚重新上演“利比亚版本”。国际社会首先应当推动叙利亚国内的和解。重要的是尽快停止暴力，无论其源头如何，最终启动全民对话，即没有先决条件、没有外国干预、尊重该国主权。这将为叙利亚领导层所公布的民主化措施得到切实履行营造条件。重要的是，不能放任大规模内战的爆发。<br><br>

我们汲取了惨痛的教训，反对通过相关的安理会决议，因为它们可能被解读为向叙利亚国内冲突发出军事干预的信号，正是遵循这一原则性立场，俄罗斯与中国在2月初才没让一条正好可能被用作不同解读的决议通过，后者可能会刺激叙利亚国内冲突中的一方采取暴力行动。<br><br>

因此，考虑到对俄中行使否决权的尖锐甚至濒于歇斯底里的反应，我想事先警告我们的西方同行，不要沉迷于采取先前使用过的简单套路，即倘若拥有联合国安理会对某个行动的许可当然不错，如果没有，就建立利益攸关国联盟，实施打击。<br><br>

此类行为的逻辑本身就是相当危险的，而且不会有任何好结局。至少无助于饱受冲突煎熬国家内部局势的调控。但更为可怕的是，它会引起整个国际安全体系的进一步失衡，损害联合国的威信和核心地位。值得一提的是，行使否决权绝非任性而为，而是《联合国宪章》中所确立的国际体系的不可分割的组成部分，更何况它正是在美国的坚持下才被写入宪章的。<br><br>

我非常希望美国和其他国家汲取惨痛教训，不要试图在不具备联合国安理会批准的情况下，在叙利亚动用武力。我简直不明白，某些人动武的欲望为何如此强烈。为什么不耐心酝酿出反复权衡、兼顾各方意见的集体立场？更何况在叙利亚决议中，该立场的轮廓其实已经相对清晰。剩下的只是向反对派武装提出同样的要求，跟先前对政府的态度一样，包括将部队从城市中撤出。倘若对此加以拒绝，就只能用卑鄙一词来形容了。如果我们想保护平民安全，而在俄罗斯看来，这一直是首要目的，就亟需说服、开导武装对抗的所有参与方。<br><br>

还有一点。目前，俄罗斯公司在所有被“阿拉伯之春”席卷的国家，跟在伊拉克一样，都失去了我们经过数十年辛苦耕耘而在当地市场上占据的份额，丢掉了大宗的商业合同。而空出来的市场则被那些参与推翻当地政权国家的企业所侵占。或许，我们会产生如下印象，即在一定程度上，引发最可怕悲剧的原因不是出于对人权的关注，而是某些势力希望重新瓜分市场。<br><br>

制造动荡<br><br>

总体来说，阿拉伯世界所发生的―切都是具有教益价值的。当地的时局发展表明，如果借助武力手段来推进民主可能而且经常会适得其反。―些势力突然冒出，其中包括宗教极端份子，试图改变国家的发展方向和世俗性质。<br><br>

“阿拉伯之春”同样表明，当前的国际舆论，是在先进信息和交流技术深入推广、积极作用的基础上形成的。可以说，互联网、社交网站、移动电话等，正在与电视一道，成为影响内政以及国际政治的有效手段。<br><br>

包括软实力在内的―些概念也相当风靡，作为实现外交目标的一揽子非武力手段及工具的集合，它主要依靠信息以及其他―些手段取胜。令人遗憾的是，这些手段经常会被用于培植和挑动极端主义、分离主义、极端民族主义情绪，操纵社会心理，对主权国家的内政直接干预。<br><br>

什么是言论自由和正常的政治意愿表达，什么是违背国际法的“软实力”手段大行其道，对此应当明确判断。对于非政府的人道主义组织和慈善团体的工作，我们当然欢迎，如勇于批评政府等。然而，一些被外部势力控制的“伪非政府组织”和其他机构，以在某些国家制造局势动荡为目的，其行为当然是绝对不能容忍的。<br><br>
